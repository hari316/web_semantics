A maiden hundred followed against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, putting him level with his father's Test ton tally, and in the next match he doubled that to become the first New Zealand opener in 24 years to achieve to score hundreds in consecutive Tests. ESPNcricinfo staff",6,12,586,48.83,16,15,325,86,25,137,9,6,83,22,13.83,34,26,573,64,23.87,"New Zealand v India at Wellington, Feb 14-18, 2014 scorecard","New Zealand v Zimbabwe at Dunedin, Feb 3, 2012 scorecard","Canterbury v Central Districts at Rangiora, Jan 8, 2012 scorecard",http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/635789.html?alt=1,"New Zealand v West Indies at Lauderhill, Jun 30, 2012 scorecard"New Zealand,BJ Watling,Bradley-John Watling,"July 9, 1985, Durban, South Africa",29 years 143 days,Right-hand bat,Wicketkeeper,"A right-handed opening batsman and part-time wicketkeeper, Bradley-John Watling spent his early years in Durban, South Africa, before moving to New Zealand as a ten-year-old.

He was the second-highest run-scorer for his state team in his third season (2006-07) with 564 runs at 37.60. He was in prime form during the one-day State Shield competition in 2008-09 with 509 runs at a stunning 63.62 and that helped him earn a place in the New Zealand one-day squad for the ODIs in the UAE against Pakistan. In 2010, after Brendon McCullum decided to keep wicket for New Zealand only in the ODIs, Watling emerged as the best long-term prospect for New Zealand in Tests, among contenders like Gareth Hopkins, Reece Young and Kruger van Wyk. Between 2009 and 2012, he played only eight Tests - the first six as a specialist batsman - before settling into the role of New Zealand's full-time wicketkeeper for the longer format in 2013.  Apart from being tidy behind the stumps, Watling's batting has also been impressive. Against India in February 2014, Watling and McCullum put together a record sixth-wicket partnership of 352 in Wellington. Watling's 124 in that Test was his first century against a top-eight nation. On the tour of West Indies, Watling's battling 66 and his 99-run partnership with Mark Craig delayed a West Indies win in Port-of-Spain. His efforts prompted McCullum to state that Watling was becoming one of his favourite cricketers.ESPNcricinfo staff",26,45,1391,35.66,22,20,528,96*,29.33,124,5,4,38,22,9.5,60,53,990,75,21.52,"New Zealand v Pakistan at Napier, Dec 11-15, 2009 scorecard","Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Dambulla, Aug 13, 2010 scorecard","Northern Districts v Wellington at Hamilton, Jan 17, 2008 scorecard",http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/798981.html?alt=3,"New Zealand v Pakistan at Dubai (DSC), Nov 12, 2009 scorecard"New Zealand,HK Bennett,Hamish Kyle Bennett,"February 22, 1987, Timaru",27 years 280 days,Bowler,Left-hand bat,"Hamish Bennett, a fast bowler for Canterbury, received his first New Zealand call-up for the tour of Bangladesh in 2010.

Only he chose to do it with one of the most inimitable masters of the game. To try to imitate is one thing, to pull it off at Test level, to imbibe it so much that it becomes you, is quite another. Brian Lara's cousin and Dwayne Bravo's half-brother, the younger Bravo, used to watch cricket only for Lara. As soon as Lara would get out, Bravo would switch off the TV and go out to bat. The result was not quite The Prince, but a talented left-hand batsman with the same walk, the same backlift, the same flourish, the same footwork, the same mannerisms.

The man was born to bat this way, right down to the same Lara leap upon reaching a century. It was that century that eluded Bravo for his first 31 ODIs, nine Tests and four T20Is. The appetite, though, was there. For a stylish and attacking batsman, he is one of the few young stars in world cricket who feel more at home as the length of the format increases. His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after. After 12 Tests his run aggregate and average were identical to that of Lara's after 12. He scored his first ODI century against Zimbabwe in 2013. Of course Bravo doesn't have to face the quality of bowling Lara did, and he bats a position lower that Lara's No. 3. Like Lara he will soon become the best batsman of a struggling batting line-up.

But when, in December 2003, he was called up to join the West Indian Test squad in South Africa, he was arguably as well known in cricket circles as either of them. All that changed, however, on the final day of the third Test at Newlands, where he brought the calypso back to Caribbean cricket with a wonderful debut century. Smith had been given a surprise opportunity - ahead of his Grenadian namesake Devon - when Marlon Samuels flew home with a knee injury. It was rumoured that Viv Richards had recognised something of himself in the stance of the young Barbadian and, sure enough, he needed just 93 balls to justify his selection, bringing up his hundred with a crashing cover-drive. It was only the second century of Smith's first-class career, but it was enough to stem West Indies' run of seven consecutive defeats in South Africa. His batting reflects both his temperament and his youth, as he is still inclined to lose his wicket under the influence of careless strokeplay, and he made starts, but no more, in the next few Tests. His flamboyant hitting is matched by his athletic fielding, while his useful medium-pacers have already tasted some success at domestic level for Barbados. Despite the fact that he eked out runs at a paltry 8.15 in 17 games in the 2006-07 season, he was picked for the World Cup squad and put in a number of good performances with his typically savage hitting. An impressive tour of England in 2007 earned him selection into West Indies' final 15-man squad for September's Twenty20 World Championship and he continued his connection with the shortest format by signing with Mumbai in the Indian Premier League in 2008.Andrew Miller May 2008",10,14,320,24.61,94,78,1338,97,18.32,NA,30,29,540,72,18.62,209,202,4775,NA,26.23,"South Africa v West Indies at Cape Town, Jan 2-6, 2004 scorecard","South Africa v West Indies at Cape Town, Jan 25, 2004 scorecard","New Zealand v West Indies at Auckland, Feb 16, 2006 scorecard",http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/728891.html,"New Zealand v West Indies at Auckland, Feb 16, 2006 scorecard"West Indies,ST Gabriel,Shannon Terry Gabriel,"April 28, 1988, Trinidad",26 years 215 days,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast-medium,"Shannon Gabriel is a fast bowler from Trinidad and Tobago who has beencompared to a young Ian Bishop.

Panyangara's family lives in Marondera, a country town about 45 miles south-east of Harare. He learned his cricket at the local primary school - Godfrey Huggins - and was a boarder at Churchill High School in Harare. His allround performances attracted the attention of Takashinga Sports Club, and he was playing for their first team while in Form Four. He won selection for the national Under-19 side in 2003 for the first time. He is tall with a smooth bowling action and is noted for his accuracy, and opens the batting for Takashinga. Panyangara had hoped to spend this and next year gaining his A-levels before becoming a professional cricketer, but instead found himself opening the bowling for the national side after the sacking of the 15 rebel players. Early in 2005 he developed a stress fracture in the back, causing him to miss a year of cricket. It is hoped he will return soon, as with his all-round talents he is viewed as a vital part of Zimbabwe's cricketing future. A passionate player, his transparent delight at success on the field is a welcome change from the often stereotyped celebrations of many other international players.John Ward June 2006",9,18,201,16.75,37,30,129,16*,5.86,NA,6,1,1,NA,-,15,5,15,10,7.5,"Zimbabwe v Sri Lanka at Harare, May 6-8, 2004 scorecard","Zimbabwe v Sri Lanka at Bulawayo, Apr 20, 2004 scorecard","Mid West Rhinos v Mountaineers at Harare, Nov 13, 2010 scorecard",http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/800713.html?alt=3,"Zimbabwe v Bangladesh at Bulawayo, May 11, 2013 scorecard"Zimbabwe,N Madziva,Neville Madziva,"August 2, 1991, Kadoma",23 years 119 days,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,NA,5,5,44,11,24,35,743,70*,30.95,25,22,14,146,NA,14.6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zimbabwe v South Africa at Bulawayo, Aug 17, 2014 scorecard","Mid West Rhinos v Kenya at Kwekwe, Nov 21, 2011 scorecard",http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/603475.html?alt=1,NAZimbabwe,SW Masakadza,Shingirai Winston Masakadza,"September 4, 1986, Harare",28 years 86 days,Bowler,Right-hand bat,"Shingi Masakadza, an honest fast-medium seamer who opens the bowling for the Mountaineers franchise, has a lot to live up to - his older brother Hamilton plays a vital role for Zimbabwe at the top of the order, was the first black African to hit a Test century and was also, for a short time, the youngest player ever to do so on debut.

He continued to put in steady performances in first-class cricket, picking up 24 wickets in 2008-9 and 40 in 2009-10, resulting in a call-up to the national side for the tour to West Indies in February 2010. He came back well after his first over in international cricket had been dispatched for 14 runs, grabbing three quick wickets at the death to seal a tense two-run victory in the first ODI in Guyana. Masakadza is also a handy lower-order batsman, with a first-class century to his name.
