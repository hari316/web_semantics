In 1733 he moved to Boston, where he established himself as an artisan, working as a glazier and a painter of houses and signs. Around 1740 he began to paint portraits as well. Like many Boston portrait limners of the day, Badger based his simple, forthright style upon the portraiture of John Smibert and Robert Feke and derived many of his compositions from European portrait prints. During the 1750s he was Bostons principal face painter and New Englands best-known artist. After 1760, however, his influence waned rapidly with the emergence of John Singleton Copley and his more sophisticated portrait art (no. 59). During his career Badger painted more than a hundred portraits, many of them likenesses of small children. A mature production of c. 1760, _Jemima Flucker_ possesses that quality of naive charm - the sweetness and fragility - which Badger typically bestowed upon his youngest sitters. The girl is dressed in a blue satin frock trimmed in white and tied loosely at the waist with a pink satin sash. The floral spray in her hair is probably a piece of jewelry, a delicate enamel and silver ornament called a _tremblant_ (a French term that alludes to the fact that the ornament trembled, and shimmered, when the wearer moved). In her right hand she holds a sprig of cherries and on her left, a pet bird. As was often the case when Badger painted children, Jemima Flucker is shown out-of-doors, her full-length form placed directly before the viewer in the foreground of a hilly landscape. The tree that frames the composition at left is almost a Badger signature, a landscape device that occurs throughout his portraiture. A resident of Boston and Cambridge, Jemima Flucker reportedly lived to the age of ninety-five and bequeathed the portrait to her only daughter Elizabeth Child, who was born in 1779. The painting remained in the possession of Jemima Fluckers descendants until 1947. The Chrysler Museum also possesses a letter written by Jemima Flucker to Elizabeth on June 15, 1795. Jefferson C.

Th√©odore Rousseau was a founding member of the Barbizon group of artists (nos. 72, 77, 80, 89, 103, 112) and one of the most esteemed landscape painters in mid-nineteenth-century France. In the late 1820s he was already at work at Chailly, near the Fontainebleau Forest. There, and on subsequent visits to the Auvergne (1830) and Normandy (1831), he produced a revolutionary series of vibrant and spontaneous _plein-air_ landscapes, pure landscapes that dispensed with traditional narrative subject matter and classical compositional schemes. Rousseaus subsequent career in Paris was a constant struggle against the conservative forces of the Salon and Acad√©mie Royale. Between 1836 and 1841 his paintings were consistently rejected by Salon juries, a cruel example of official persecution that earned him the sardonic soubriquet, _le grande refus√©_. In 1841 the frustrated Rousseau turned his back on the Salon, where he did not exhibit again until 1849. The years of rejection had their effect on the artist, who took care after 1850 to produce landscapes more in line with official taste. These composed and carefully worked pictures borrowed much from the landscape art of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. _A Clearing in the Forest of Fontainebleau_, one of several canvases that Rousseau undertook at Barbizon in 1860-62 is an impressive example of his mature, more finished and traditional style. Its composition and the handling of foliage recall particularly the works of the Dutch landscapist Meindert Hobbema. the site depicted may be the _Carrefour de la Reine Blanche_ (The Crossroads of the White Queen), a glade in the forest near Barbizon. The site was a favorite of Rousseaus. Three of his other paintings show the same spot; the best known of these is in the Louvre, Paris. The Chrysler Museum picture conveys the clarity and dewy calm of a spring morning near Barbizon, when the first rays of the rising sun bathe the ancient oaks of Fontainebleau in a golden glow.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2059 In the decades following Napoleons Egyptian campaign (1798-99), Europeans became increasingly fascinated by the rich and still mysterious Islamic cultures of the East, prompting many to travel there for a closer look. In their quest for new and exotic experiences, artists, too, journeyed to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, or Holy Land-a vast, ethnically diverse region that Europeans described simply as the Orient. Returning home, many artists specialized in romantic depictions of Moroccan, Egyptian, and Near Eastern life, fueling the European taste for Orientalist art. The Parisian painter Lecomte-Vernet made the journey at least once, in 1863, and devoted much of his later career to images of beautiful North African women in elaborate, ceremonial dress.

Such paintings were often collaborative efforts. The central figurative scene was typically executed by a history painter adept at figure composition, while the wreath of flowers was supplied by a still-life specialist. The Museums example was painted in Antwerp in 1651 by one of the most inspired of these Flemish collaborative teams: the history painter Erasmus II Quellinus and the still-life specialist Jan Philips van Thielen, both of whom signed the painting. During their 20-year collaboration, Quellinus and Van Thielen produced a number of garland paintings featuring trompe loeil (illusionistic) stone sculptures set in elaborate sculpted frames, or cartouches, and surrounded by flowers. Acquired in London in 1994, the present painting is among the most ambitious of these and also one of the largest; it measures more than four by three feet and is painted on a single sheet of copper measuring less than a quarter of an inch in thickness. At the center Quellinus depicts grisaille (unpainted) sculptures of the Virgin and Infant Christ subduing the serpent. In its mouth the serpent clutches the apple of original sin. Quellinus sets the figures in an elaborate Baroque cartouche crowned at the upper corners with a pair of pelicans. These ancient symbols of selfless love refer to Christs sacrifice on the cross. Van Thielen weaves the cartouche with ivy, an emblem of eternal life through Christ, and a brilliant halo of blooms - roses, jasmine, snow drops, tulips, nasturtium, apple blossoms and anemones, which symbolize the virtues of the Virgin and Child and pay tribute to their holiness. The flowers are enlivened with moths and butterflies, which allude to Christs resurrection. Before the Museum purchased the painting, the collection contained no still life produced before the mid-18th century. Thus, the painting filled a major gap in the collection and enriches the Museums presentation of 17th-century Catholic art and thought.

Moreland_ _1792_ Gift of Morrie A. Moss, 74.5.2 An artistic prodigy, George Morland was already exhibiting drawings at Londons Royal Academy by the age of ten. The elder Morland - a painter and an art dealer who restored Old Master pictures - was cynically aware of the commercial value of his sons precocious talent, and he pushed him to perfect his craft. While apprenticed to his father in 1777-84, the boy was kept perpetually busy. He made drawings for sale and copied the popular landscapes of Joseph Vernet and the Dutch and Flemish paintings that his father restored in his studio. Once free of his father, Morland rejected the strict discipline of his early years and embraced a life of reckless self-indulgence. Despite his increasingly dissolute ways, he produced a remarkable number of pictures. Many of them were cosigned to unscrupulous art dealers who systematically underpaid him and kept him in debt. He died, alcoholic and debt-ridden, at the age of forty-one. During the later 1780s Morland specialized in moralizing genre paintings of upper-middle class life and in fashionable, sentimental pictures of children at play. After 1790 he turned almost exclusively to picturesque scenes of English country life - interiors of stables and landscapes with gypsies, smugglers and peasants. These subjects were determined partly by the Dutch paintings he had first encountered in his fathers shop and partly by the coastal scenes of Vernet and Philipp de Loutherbourg. Influential, too, were the contemporary landscape styles of Thomas Gainsborough (no. 58) and the French rococo masters. With his landscapes Morland forged a vision of rustic English life that affected native artists for generations. The finest works of Morlands uneven career were his country scenes of the early 1790s. Among them is _A View of Westmorland_ of 1792, which reveals the artist at the height of his powers. Here an apparently innocent genre interlude is made the pretext for a stunning evocation of the English coast. The painting depicts a peasant family proceeding toward the shore where two men await them in a boat. The rather anxious, covert glance of the woman suggests that she and her family are actually involved in the not so innocent act of smuggling contraband, an activity often depicted in Morlands landscapes. Though the figures possess the solidity and the mass of seventeenth-century Dutch masters, the landscape itself, evoked in fluid strokes, is a lush tribute to the rococo. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2080 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 16. Gros originally achieved fame in Paris as one of Napoleons principal painters, glorifying the emperor and his military exploits in a series of vast, heroic canvases. In these works he employed a style inspired less by the Neoclassicism of his revered teacher Jacques-Louis David than by the paintings of Rubens (no. 16), which he had studied during his years in Italy (1793-1800). Gros style, with its passionate emotion and vibrant colors, was hailed by the rising generation of French Romantic painters. The most famous of his Napoleonic history paintings, _The Pesthouse at Jaffa_ (Louvre, Paris), was the highlight of the 1804 Salon; with it, Gros reputation was secured. Despite his success, Gros became increasingly worried that he had abandoned the lofty principles of Davids art for what he called the impertinence and vagabondage of Romantic style, and with Davids death in 1825, he sensed the need to return to an art more strictly aligned to the Neoclassicism of his former mentor. This reversion to an older, and no longer fashionable, manner isolated Gros from many of his earlier supporters, and his art became the object of mounting criticism. The crisis came at the 1835 Salon. There Gros exhibited two works of decidedly classical style and subject matter - _Hercules and Diomedes_ (Mus√©e des Augustins, Toulouse) and _Acis and Galatea_, which the artist had painted in Davids memory two years before. The devastating critical response caused Gros to fall into a deep depression, and, soon thereafter, he drowned himself in the Seine. Today Gros is rightly recognized as the crucial link between the austere and learned classicism of his teacher David and the more colorful Romanticism of...Delacroix (Francis Broun). Gros took the mythological subject of _Acis and Galatea_ from a passage in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (13:738-897). In it the nymph Galatea is courted by the hideous Cyclops, Polyphemus, whose love she spurns for that of the shepherd Acis. To proclaim his love, the Cyclops makes music upon his pipes, while Acis and Galatea hide nearby listening. The giant soon spies the pair and, raging with jealousy, crushes Acis beneath a boulder. In Gros painting the terror-stricken lovers, concealed in a cave at waters edge, cower at the approach of Polyphemus, who stalks the countryside blowing his horn. Gros critics balked at the paintings melodramatic tone. They complained, too, that its figures lacked grace, but conceded that they were effectively drawn. In truth, both figures were modeled upon antique sculptural prototypes: Galateas pose recalls that of the so-called Crouching Aphrodite, while Acis suggests the stance of a combative Hercules. The painting and two preliminary drawings (locations unknown) were dispersed during the posthumous sale of Gros studio in November of 1835. In 1863 the picture was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Del√®stre, a former student of Gros who authored the first biography of the artist. Jefferson C.

The Neapolitan school of painting began its rise to international prominence somewhat belatedly, in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Previously Naples had been a provincial art center, its painters influenced and overshadowed by the traditionally more progressive schools of Florence and Rome. As did many of his sixteenth-century colleagues, the Neapolitan Criscuolo no doubt visited Rome. There, his art was transformed by Raphaels High Renaissance paintings and by the Mannerist works of Raphael followers like Perino del Vaga. Returning to Naples, he devised a version of Roman Mannerism that made him one of the mores sophisticated painters in that still parochial center. As his career progressed, Criscuolo - and the Neapolitan school with him - embraced more fully the tenets of the Roman and Florentine high _maniera_ (later Mannerist style), prompted no doubt by visits from itinerant painters like Giorgio Vasari in 1544. A work of Crisculos early post-Roman maturity, the undated _Adoration of the Magi_ has been placed by scholars in the mid-1540s on the strength of its strong stylistic resemblance to the artists 1545 _Adoration with the Trinity_ in the Museo e Gallerie Nazionali di Capodimonte, Naples. In the _Adoration of the Magi_, Criscuolo reshapes the art of Perino del Vaga in more current _maniera_ style, creating an elegant image of self conscious grace, of characteristically compressive _maniera_ forms and surface suavity. The artists essentially two dimensional design is particularly pronounced in the forms of the three kings, which have been flattened against the picture plane in a dense pattern of sinuous line and shifting color and texture. As they present their gifts to the Child, the three kings - the young Moor Balthasar, the middle-aged Melchior and the grey bearded Caspar - proclaim the allegiance of all earthly rulers to the divine King of Kinds. Symbolizing this act of fealty is the crown that the eldest magus has pulled from his head and placed on the steps beneath Christs feet. Its piers crumbling and overgrown with vines, the architectural ruin behind the Holy Family serves as a venerable Christian symbol for the old Jewish law, which was destroyed by the coming of Christ. Though based ultimately on High Renaissance canons, the faces and forms of Virgin and child have been keyed to a sharper _maniera_ pitch and, thus, exhibit a more rarified and eccentric kind of beauty. Remarkable, too, are Criscuolos palette of acidic blues, greens and yellows and the snarling griffin carved from the leg of Christs throne. Criscuolos paintings are rare in American collections, and the _Adoration of the Magi_ offers a unique and exceptionally fine example of provincial Italian response to Roman high style in the mid-sixteenth century.

Together with Veronese and the aging Titian, Tintoretto was a presiding master of the Venetian school of painting in the second half of the sixteenth century. The sign over his studio door read the color of Titian, the drawing of Michelangelo. His bold combination of northern and central Italian techniques yielded a passionate and lyrical late Mannerist style that brought him countless private and public commissions in Venice. Despite surface abrasion and darkened pigments, Tintorettos inimitable painterly technique can be seen in his treatment of Floras left ankle formed by trails of phosphorescent white, and in the fluid, glazed golds of her luminous hair.","Provenance":"Painted ca. 1555 for the Palazzo Barbo, San Pantaleone, Venice (original location); Private collection, Southern France, 1957; Newhouse Galleries, 1958; Walter P.

Together with Veronese (no. 13) and the aging Titian, Tintoretto presided over the Venetian school of painting during the second half of the sixteenth century. His style was formed by Michelangelo, the Venetian Mannerists and Titian, to whom he may have been apprenticed. From them he forged an art of violent energy and monumental sweep, a passionate late Mannerist style marked by an astonishing technical freedom. Tintoretto and his many assistants worked almost continuously on large-scale commissions for Venetian churches, palaces, charitable confraternities and government buildings, covering acres of wall and ceiling with a feverish velocity that dumbfounded his rivals. As had the classical writers and artists who influenced them so profoundly, sixteenth-century European painters frequently used the cycle of the seasons as a metaphor for the eternal passage of time. Their paintings of the seasons were often produced in sets of four, with each picture featuring a male or female figure who personified the particular season with the help of appropriate seasonal attributes. Following traditional practice, Tintoretto produced his _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ around 1555 as part of a series of four paintings of the seasons. Here, a lively and robust Flora, goddess of flowers and spring, shakes off the torpor of winter. The spray of flowers that seems to issue from her womb shows that she is fertile with the promise of new life. She is a splendid, full-bodied symbol of the generative power of the reawakening earth. Tintorettos companion pictures of _Summer_ and _Winter_ survive: the former is found in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the latter in a private collection in Bergamo. The concluding painting of _Autumn_ has yet to be recovered. The Chrysler Museum and National Gallery paintings were originally fitted with octagonal frames that covered their corners. The seventeenth-century biographer of Venetian artists, Carlo Ridolfi, noted in his _Le Maraviglie dellArte_ (1648) that Tintoretto produced a set of Seasons pictures as part of his decoration of a room in the Barbo Palace in Venice: In the Palazzo Barbo at San Pantaleone one sees in the panelling of one room a Capriccio of Dreams with some gods in heaven and various symbols of things that come into the minds of men while they are dreaming; in the surrounding area the Four Seasons are personified. Scholars have suggested that the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace was a ceiling painting and that it can be identified with a large, octagonal canvas by Tintoretto in the Detroit Institute of the Arts, the so-called _Dreams of Man_. It has also been proposed that the _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ and its three companion paintings are the Four Seasons that originally flanked the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace, composing, perhaps, a frieze of paintings along the tops of the walls.

Some believe that these three men in Italian medieval and Renaissance dress-an architect, a monk, and a poet-are meant to portray specific, famous Italians-possibly the painter and architect Giotto, the Florentine firebrand Savonarola, and the creator of the Divine Comedy, Dante. Others have suggested that the figures should be viewed more broadly as allegorical embodiments of artistic, religious, and poetic inspiration-as personifications of the different aspects of Renaissance genius engaged in a colloquy on the nature of art and the spirit. Puvis painted this tribute to Italian greatness at the age of twenty-four, while visiting Rome in 1848. It was the young artists first major painting, and it clearly reflects his early interest in the robust, romantic art of Thomas Couture and Ary Scheffer. Puvis went on to achieve great fame in France for his large-scale mural paintings. Using an altogether different style marked by a flat, decorative approach to the human figure, he created in these works a pale and silent realm of motionless, columnar forms-a remote world of dreams that enchanted the Symbolists of the 1880s and 1890s. Yet even in early works like Allegory, we can trace the basic features of those mature works-their sense of mystery, gentle poetry, and contemplative calm.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"Signed and inscribed: Rome, 1848.","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr., 71.545 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 41. The marine and landscape specialist Jongkind was, perhaps, the most important precursor of the French Impressionist school. He served as mentor to Eug√®ne Boudin (no. 109) and to the young Claude Monet, whom he encountered in Normandy in the summer of 1862 and impressed greatly with his sparkling _plein-air_ pen sketches and watercolors. From that time on, Monet wrote, he was my real master, and it was to him that I owed the final education of my eye. Born and trained initially in Holland, Jongkind arrived in Paris in 1846 and joined the atelier of the famous marine painter Eug√®ne Isabey. Within a year he was painting along the Normandy and Brittany coasts. He made his debut at the 1848 Salon, and though his works sold well, he was plagued by debts and was often deeply depressed. At his mothers death in 1855, Jongkind suffered a nervous collapse and withdrew to Holland, where he lived for five years as an impoverished semi-recluse. After his return to Paris in 1860, however, his fortunes brightened, largely through the efforts of his enthusiastic patron Th√©ophile Bascle and his new-found companion Josephine Fesser-Borrh√©e. By the mid-1860s Jongkind had reached his creative pinnacle, producing some of the most vibrant and spontaneous of his Pre-Impressionist landscapes. Among these mature works is the 1866 _Along the Ourcq_, which was apparently purchased from the artist by Bascle. The painting depicts the Ourcq canal, which lies just northeast of Paris. Since Mme Fesser-Borrh√©es brother-in-law lived near the canal, in the village of Pantin, Jongkind had ample opportunity to study and paint the waterway and its well-trodden towpaths. The Ourcq was, in fact, one of Jongkinds preferred sites in the mid-1860s, when he sketched and painted it repeatedly under varying atmospheric conditions - in sunlight, in moonlight, in the rain. An 1864 painting of the canal by Jongkind, today in the collection of Paul Mellon (Upperville, Virginia), and a watercolor view from the same year (private collection, Paris) directly anticipate the design of The Chrysler Museum canvas. Jongkind customarily composed his paintings in the studio, consulting sketches he had made _sur le motif_ (on the spot). Thought not painted out-of-doors, _Along the Ourcq_ nonetheless conveys the freshness and freedom of a rapidly executed _plein-air_ impression. These were the very qualities that attracted Monet and, as Boudin said, opened the door through which all the Impressionists passed. Jefferson C.

Others, like the Parisian sculptor Prosper dEpinay, held firm to the traditional tenets of academic classicism. The smooth, idealized forms, meticulously finished surface, and open sentimentality of DEpinays impressive marble group, Amor Forgiven, are typical of the kind of conservative, academic sculpture that dominated the Paris Salon in the final decades of the 19th century. Though this kind of sculpture fell out of fashion with the rise of modernist art in the early 20th century, it has recently returned to favor and is now avidly sought by collectors. Classical mythology is filled with stories about the love goddess Venus and her mischievous winged offspring Cupid, who often disobeyed his mother and aimed his arrows of love at the wrong targets. In DEpinays sculpture, Venus gathers her son in her arms, presumably forgiving him for one of his transgressions. DEpinays lighthearted mythological subject is largely a pretext for a fetching portrayal of a sensual female nude and cherubic child in playful embrace. The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923). By the mid-20th century it was owned by the family of Lydia Aspergren of Norfolk, who donated it to the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences in 1963. Kept largely in storage since then, the sculpture was recently cleaned for exhibit in Behind the Seen. Conservation Project After sitting in storage for decades, DEpinays Amor Forgiven was in need of a thorough surface cleaning. In August of 2005, sculpture conservator Andrew Baxter was contracted to clean the sculpture in time for its exhibition in Behind the Seen. Mr. Baxter began the process by dry cleaning the surface with a vacuum and erasures, removing as much grime as possible before moving on to soap and water. Using swabs and brushes, he next wet-cleaned the surface with a non-ionic soap. To draw out deeply embedded stains, he applied clay poultices to the surface. Once the cleaning process was complete, Mr. Baxter covered the surface with a protective coating of wax.","Provenance":"The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923).

Though celebrated today as one of the earliest and most creative of the Impressionists, the landscapist Sisley enjoyed no such recognition during his lifetime. From the early 1870s, when he began to paint professionally, until his death in 1899, he practiced his art in poverty and obscurity, struggling in vain against a hostile public and indifferent press. A Parisian by birth, Sisley entered the atelier of Charles Gleyre (no. 100) in 1862 and there befriended fellow students Claude Monet, Fr√©d√©ric Bazille and Renoir (no. 113). Within months the four young artists had departed from Gleyres studio for Chailly-en-Bi√®re and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There, through their communal experiments with _plein-air_ painting, they sowed the first seeds of Impressionism, and by 1870 Sisleys landscapes had begun to exhibit the clear, high-keyed tones and sketchy, broken color touches of the new style. Though his later landscapes displayed the formal disintegrations inherent in the Impressionist technique, Sisley remained committed to an art of compositional and spatial clarity, to architectonically structured landscapes and carefully calibrated perspectives. Sisley spent most of his life working in the villages and countryside around Paris. Initially he lived in or near Louveciennes (1871-74), Marly-le-Roi (1875-77) and S√®vres (1877-79) and showed a special interest in river and snow scenes. In later years (1880-99) he resided near Fontainebleau in the hamlets of Veneux-Nadon and neighboring Moret, at the juncture of the Seine and Loing rivers, where he repeatedly painted the banks of these waterways and the adjacent fields. Produced at the onset of his final Moret period, _Apple Trees in Flower_ of 1880 portrays the crisp, breezy weather of early spring, when the chill of winter still lingers on the land. Its forms merely summarized by Sisleys dappling, Impressionist brush, the landscape is brought into structural focus through the anchoring verticals of the blossoming fruit trees. The receding lines of the trees also create a sense of deep space, a characteristic feature of Sisleys art. Sisley relished the challenge of capturing the transitory effects of light and weather and the fleeting magic of seasonal change. In an enthusiastic letter written from Moret in the spring of 1883, he reported: The weather has been wonderful. I have started work again, but unfortunately, because it has been such a dry spring, the fruit trees are not flowering all at once, and the blossoms are dropping very quickly. And I am trying to paint them! Jefferson C. Harrison. _The Chrysler Museum Handbook of the European and American Collections: Selected Paintings, Sculpture and Drawings_.

Fromentin possessed remarkably varied artistic talents. He achieved fame not only as a painter, but as a travel writer, novelist, and art critic. After devoting his youth to the study of law, he resolved to become an artist and in 1844 began his training in Paris with the landscape painter Louis Cabat. A fleeting visit to Algeria in 1846 confirmed his growing interest in romantic, Orientalist themes (see nos. 76, 99). When two of his North African pictures were applauded at the 1847 Salon in Paris - his public debut - he returned to Algeria for a longer stay. By 1850 Fromentin was well-known in France as a leading Orientalist painter, and his final Algerian sojourn of 1852-53 provided enough material to sustain him in this genre for the rest of his life. Fromentins passionate interest in North Africa inspired him to write two travel accounts, _A Summer in the Sahara_ and _A Year in the Sahel_, in the later 1850s. In 1862 his famous novel _Dominique_ appeared in print, and just before his untimely death at age fifty-five, he issued his treatise on Dutch and Flemish painting, _Les Ma√Ætres dautrefois_, which is viewed today as one of the most significant pieces of art criticism produced in the nineteenth century. Displayed at the 1863 Salon, The Chrysler Museum painting captures one of Fromentins favorite and most picturesque subjects - the nomadic Arab plainsman astride his coursing steed. Here a falconer on the hunt races before his comrades, clutching in his upraised hand a perch and the leather leashes holding his birds of prey. Fromentins Salon offerings elicited almost unanimously positive reactions from conservative critics and the public, and the _Arab Falconers_ was especially well received. The critic Paul Mantz, for example, marveled at the spirited conception of the horseman, who seemed bewitched by the seductions of the chase. The figure...is full of movement and wild energy. Others praised the artists fluid handling of the brush, which bathes the paintings surface in veils of liquid color. Many European artists of the day viewed the Arab plainsman as an uncorrupted child of Nature, a heroic Noble Savage whose life was still intimately tied to the rhythms and pulse of nature. Fromentin endorses this romanticized view in the _Arab Falconer_, in which the hunter seems as fierce and wild as his mount and birds of prey. The great popularity of the painting encouraged Fromentin to repeat its composition, in mirror image, one year later in a picture now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A closely related watercolor, possibly a study for the _Arab Falconer_, is in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Jefferson C.

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.517 Millet was the leader of the Barbizon School, the group of French landscape and genre painters who abandoned Paris around 1850 to work in the village of Barbizon and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There Millet and his Barbizon colleagues produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes -among them, Babys Slumber- that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants. The simplicity and directness of these pictures helped shape the new Realist style that surfaced in French art in the mid-nineteenth century. Babys Slumber depicts the interior of a peasant cottage bathed in soft summer light. In it a young woman busies herself with domestic chores -sewing and mending- while with her foot she rocks her sleeping child in its cradle. Visible through the open window, a man -presumably her husband- works in the garden beyond. Millets vision of maternal devotion and domestic harmony in the countryside serves as a tribute to the timeless virtues of the French peasantry -patience, diligence, perseverance- and to the dignity and continuity of life on the land.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1855-1861; probably Alfred Sensier, Paris, 1861; S.F.

Within a decade he had become a leader of the small, but influential group of landscape and genre painters that had assembled in that tiny village near the Fontainebleu Forest (nos. 72, 77, 86, 103, 112). There, inspired by seventeenth-century Dutch painting and warm recollections of his peasant upbringing in Normandy, Millet produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes - among them _Babys Slumber_ of c. 1855 - that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants (see also nos. 81, 89). The humble naturalism of these pictures - their naive directness of vision (Robert Herbert) - helped shape the new Realist aesthetic that surfaced in French painting in the mid-nineteenth century. While at Barbizon, Millet instructed a number of younger American painters, who helped to popularize his work in the United States, particularly in Boston. Among them was the Boston artist Edward Wheelwright, who came to Barbizon to study with Millet in October, 1855. Wheelwright stayed on until the following spring and published his recollections in 1876 in the _Atlantic Monthly_; one of the noteworthy events he recounted was his viewing of _Babys Slumber_. Not long after Millet had finished the picture, Wheelwright and several other painters visited his studio while he was away in Paris on business. Inspecting his canvases one by one, they happened upon the painting: At last was brought out from its hiding place a picture representing the interior of a peasants cottage. A young mother was seated, knitting or sewing, while with one foot she rocked the cradle in which lay a child asleep....Anything more exquisitely beautiful than this sleeping child has rarely, I believe, been painted. Through the open window the eye looked out into a garden where a man with his back turned appeared to be at work. The whole scene gave the impression of a hot summers day; you could almost see the trembling motion of the heated air outside, you could almost smell the languid scent of flowers, you could almost hear the droning of the bees, and you could positively feel the absolute quiet and repose, the solemn silence, that pervaded the picture. All those at least felt it who saw the picture upon that...morning. A sudden hush fell upon all the noisy and merry party....The silence that was in some way painted into the canvas seemed to distill from it into the surrounding air. To give depth and resonance to his genre images, Millet frequently alluded to biblical or classical themes. _Babys Slumber_ suggests the domestic harmony of the Holy Family, a parallel that lends an air to sacredness to this modest peasant scene.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.650 Reference: Yale, 1987-88, no. 11. The iridescent color schemes and illusionistic designs of late Baroque decoration were first championed in Naples by Luca Giordano. He was the unrivaled leader of the Neapolitan school of painting during the second half of the seventeenth century and one of the most influential of contemporary European artists. His extraordinary speed and productivity as a painter were legendary. Colleagues called him the Thunderbolt and _Luca fa presto_. Equally dazzling was his capacity to imitate the works of other artists. His boundless talent for creative mimicry was first honed by his father Antonio, a Neapolitan painter and copyist, and in time it earned him the nickname Proteus. For Giordano, the decades after 1650 were marked by almost constant travel - to Florence, Venice, Rome and eventually to Spain. Already by 1660 he had abandoned the dark, Caravaggesque style of Jusepe de Ribera, quite possibly one of his teachers, for a lighter, more colorful late Baroque manner derived from Pietro da Cortonas Roman works and those of the great sixteenth-century Venetians. The Chrysler Museum painting is one of at least three pictures by Giordano (Museo del Castelvecchio, Verona; Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden) that illustrate the mythology of Bacchus and Ariadne. A fluent work of full maturity, it has been dated to Giordanos Florentine sojourn of 1685-86. The dating is based on its strong stylistic kinship to the artists contemporary frescos in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, and particularly to the Medici-Riccardi _Triumph of Bacchus_. As recounted in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (8:170-182) and other classical sources, Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, helped her beloved Theseus escape the Labyrinth and then sailed with him to the island of Naxos, where he deserted her. Heartbroken at her abandonment, she was discovered on the shore by Bacchus, god of wine, who fell in love with her and, after his voyage to India, returned to marry her. He then placed her marriage crown in the heavens, where it was transformed into a constellation, the corona borealis. In Giordanos painting a love-smitten Bacchus and his celebrants -- maenads, satyrs, putti -- encounter Ariadne for the first time, stealing up on her as she slumbers sadly at waters edge. Ariadnes future betrothal is forecast in the crown of stars that hovers above her. The paintings stately tone and cool palette of silvery pinks and blues evoke Poussin and Titian, while the striding figure of Bacchus pays homage specifically to Titians _Bacchus and Ariadne_ in the National Gallery, London. In Ariadnes pose the inspired mimic Giordano presents a witty reprise of Michelangelos sculpture of _Night_from the Tomb of Guiliano deMedici (San Lorenzo, Florence). Jefferson C.

In the art academies of eighteenth-century Europe, painters of historical and religious themes (see nos. 47, 52) were valued far more highly than those who devoted themselves to the minor subjects of genre, landscape, and still life. Yet, the most inspired interpreters of the minor subjects could achieve considerable fame in their lifetimes and genuine immortality in the annals of art history. One such genius was Chardin, who was among the most revered painters of still life and genre in mid-eighteenth-century Paris. Championed particularly by the influential philosopher and art critic Denis Diderot (d. 1784), Chardin enjoyed both official and popular success. He was an honored member of the Acad√©mie Royale and a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon, and his paintings were avidly collected by a newly affluent French middle class. In his later still lifes, Chardin abandoned his earlier interest in the meticulous delineation of texture and detail and concentrated on more profound visual elements. Color and volume, half-light and highlight, the broad compositional interplay of solid and void - these became the underlying concerns of his mature still lifes such as the _Basket of Plums_. When the painting - or its replica, which is located today in a private French collection - was shown by Chardin at the 1765 Salon, Diderot described it briefly in his commentaries on the exhibition: ...placed on a stone bench, a wicker basket full of plus, for which a paltry string serves as a handle, and scattered around it some walnuts, two or three cherries and a few small bunches of grapes [in truth, white currants]. Though the arrangement is typically spare, the effect on the eye is magical. The luscious mound of purple and rosy red plums smolders in the shadowy light. The currants gleam like pearls. What emerges from this humble assembly of fruits and nuts, and from the velvety brushwork that informs it, is a vision of the poetic essence of objects that dazzled Chardins contemporaries and captivates us perhaps even more today.

In 1907, the year following C√©zannes death, the portion of the mural containing the nude was detached from the plaster wall, transferred to canvas, and sold.

A major influence on early twentieth-century modernism, C√©zanne labored to restore structure and intellectual control to painting following the era of Impressionism. I want to make of Impressionism something solid, he once proclaimed, like the art of the Museums. In his mature paintings of the 1880s and 1890s, and particularly in his later landscapes and still lifes, C√©zanne portrayed the visible world as an architectonic interlocking of colors and simple, reductive forms, a tight and permanent semiabstraction that would in time inspire the Cubism of Picasso and Braque (no. 139). C√©zannes mature, Post-Impressionist style began to emerge after 1872, when his encounters with Camille Pissarro (no. 96) rapidly transformed his art. Before that time, the young painter had worked in an altogether different style, a blunt and brooding Romantic mode full of dark energy and often violent emotion. This early style, which scholars have only recently begun to research in depth, is revealed to spectacular effect in _Bather and Rocks_ of c. 1860-66. C√©zanne initially divided his time between his native Provence and Paris, where his paintings were consistently refused by the Salon and ridiculed by the critics at the Impressionist exhibits of 1874, 1876 and 1877. After 1877 he secluded himself more and more in Provence - at LEstaque and in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence - and there lived the life of a misanthropic recluse. He often worked in these years at the Jas de Bouffan, his familys country estate on the outskirts of Aix. C√©zannes father, a hard-nosed banker who had little patience for his sons artistic aspirations, purchased the seventeenth-century mansion of the Jas de Bouffan in 1859. Soon after, he reluctantly agreed to let C√©zanne have a studio there. During the following decade he also allowed his son to decorate the grand salon of the Jas de Bouffan with murals of his own design. These large-scale paintings, which C√©zanne executed in oil directly on the plaster walls of the room, are among the most ambitious of his early works. They included two large landscape murals, painted in 1860-62. Probably after his visit to Paris in 1862-64, C√©zanne added the figure of a massively-muscled male nude seen from behind to one of these landscapes - a rocky vista with pine trees and a rushing stream. This _Landscape with Bather_ remained _in situ_ and intact until 1907, the year after C√©zannes death. At that time Louis Granel, who had purchased the house from the artist in 1899, had most of the murals detached from the walls, transferred to canvas and readied for sale. The only portion of the _Landscape with Bather_ that was removed from the wall (and saved from destruction) was the nude male figure - i.e., the _Bather and Rocks_ that is today in The Chrysler Museum. The design and dorsal presentation of C√©zannes nude were clearly influenced by Gustave Courbet, as can be seen, for example, from Courbets 1853 painting of _The Bathers_ in the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier. However, the style of C√©zannes figure - its turbulent brush technique and heavy, black contours - more closely recalls the passionate Romantic art of Delacroix (no. 76). Jefferson C.

Born in Honfleur, the landscape and marine painter Boudin was the son of a Norman ships captain. In his mature pictures he repeatedly portrayed the grand sweep of sea and sky along the French Atlantic coast. Though his first years as a painter were not easy, Boudin remained true to his brisk _plein-air_ technique, and in 1858, at Rouelles in Normandy, he began to teach the young Claude Monet how to paint out-of-doors. The budding Impressionist was soon entranced by the directness of Boudins approach and by his ability to capture the ever-changing qualities of natures light and atmosphere. If I have become a painter, Monet later said, I owe it to Eug√®ne Boudin. Boudins role as mentor to Monet - a role later assumed by Johan Jongkind (no. 95) - confirmed his position as one of Frances most important Pre-Impressionist painters. Boudin received his first recognition in the mid-1860s with his now-famous Trouville and Deauville beach scenes. Executed _en plein air_ with a revolutionary fluidity and dash, these small paintings of fashionable Second-Empire vacationers at seaside were applauded at the Salon in Paris and laid the groundwork for his subsequent success. In later productions like _Beached Boats at Berck_ - an unusually large landscape for Boudin - the artist somewhat tempered his early style with a more deliberate, descriptive realism. The site depicted in the painting is the shore at Berck-sur-Mer, a small village along the English Channel between Dieppe and Calais. Boudin had already visited Berck in 1874, five years before he produced the picture. In the painting, Norman fishermen rest in the humid haze of a summer afternoon, their boats temporarily beached by the receding tide. Some of the fishermen repair their craft, while others take their midday meal. The vast canopy of cloud-filled sky is masterfully portrayed, confirming Corots salute to Boudin as the king of skies. The Impressionists were fascinated by Boudins ability to evoke specific kinds of weather and times of day. So, too, were the critics. One can guess the very season, the time of day, and the wind in Boudins work, marveled Charles Baudelaire in his account of the 1859 Salon. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2633 Painter, sculptor, and draftswoman, Rosa Bonheur built her career in Paris as an animali√®re, a portrayer of animals, which she rendered in a meticulously realist style. Independent and strong-willed, Bonheur ignored the limitations placed on academic training for women and instead taught herself art. She made life studies of farm animals-horses, bull, cows-and copied earlier animal paintings found in the Louvre. She studied animal anatomy in the citys slaughter-houses and even dissected animals at the National Veterinary Institute. Her efforts bore fruit in 1855, when her monumental Horse Fair (see illustration) brought her international acclaim. Like Harriet Hosmer in Rome, Bonheur cut an eccentric figure in Paris, favoring female companions, mens clothes, and cigarettes. When challenged on her unconventional wardrobe, she merely claimed it simplified her field work with animals: I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my sex was a constant bother. This is why I solicited the authorization to wear mens clothing from the prefect of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire, and nothing else. The epithets of imbeciles have never bothered me.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

The Bust of the Savior was his last work, carved by his own hand at the age of eighty in spiritual preparation for his imminent death. He willed it to his friend and patron, Christina, Queen of Sweden, Romes preeminent Catholic convert. Bernini created a majestic Christ, his head turned heavenward to intercede between God and humankind: the Salvador Mundi (Savior of the World) raises his right hand in eternal blessing. The gesture also alludes to Christs metamorphosis from mortal to divine being. After Christs resurrection and before his ascension into heaven he took care that his body remain undefiled. Noli Me Tangere, he commanded, with his right hand raised. Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). Bernini designed an elaborate seven-foot-high pedestal to support the sculptures base. Viewed from below and at a distance, Christs elongated and exaggerated features would have appeared slightly foreshortened and softened. Sculpted kneeling angels were to support the marble Christ. Roman Catholics would have associated this elevated image of the Savior with the priests Elevation of the Host during Mass (the celebration of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion).","Provenance":"The artist, 1679-1680; Queen Christina of Sweden, Rome, 1680-1689; Pope Innocent XI, Odescalchi, 1689; The Palazzo Odescalchi, 1713; Vicomte Jacques de Canson, Paris, 1952; Walter P.

Bernini was the greatest sculptor and architect of the seventeenth century and the major founder of Italian High Baroque style. An artistic demigod who dominated the Roman art world for more than fifty years, he was courted by kings and popes throughout his career. At the time of his death - he succumbed to a stroke in Rome in 1680 - he was revered throughout Europe. Bernini began the marble _Bust of the Savior_ in 1679, only a year before his death. Both of his early biographers, Filippo Baldinucci (1682) and Berninis son Domenico (1713), discuss the work at length. They record that the artist intended to present the bust - his final work - as a gift to his dear friend and ardent supporter, Queen Christina of Sweden, who was then living in Rome. Baldinucci writes: Bernini was already in the eightieth year of his life. For some time past he had been turning his most intense thoughts to attaining eternal repose rather than to increasing his earthly glory. Also, deep within his heart was the desire to offer, before closing his eyes to this life, some sign of gratitude to Her Majesty the Queen of Sweden, his most special patron. In order, therefore, to penetrate more deeply into the first concept and to prepare himself better for the second, he set to work with the greatest intensity to create in marble a half -length figure, larger than life-size, of Our Savior Jesus Christ. This is the work that he said was his favorite and it was the last given to the world by his hand. According to Baldinucci, Christina refused the gift in a moment of royal self-deprecation: The Queens opinion of, and esteem for, the statue was so great that, not finding herself in circumstances in which it was possible to give a comparable gift in exchange, she chose to reject it rather than fail in the slightest degree to equal the royal magnificence of her intention. Bernini then bequeathed the bust to her, and, at Christinas death in 1689, it passed to Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi, in whose family it remained at least until 1713, when it was mentioned in an inventory of the Palazzo Odescalchi. By then the sculpture had achieved considerable fame, having been chosen as the official emblem of the Apostolic Hospital in Rome. An early description of the bust states that it originally stood atop an elaborate and richly ornamented pedestal that rose more than seven feet from the floor. Constructed from Berninis own design, the pedestal was composed of a gilded wooden socle, stepped at the top, that supported a pair of kneeling angels, also in gilded wood. The angels, in turn, upheld the bust on a base of Sicilian jasper. As Irving Lavin noted in 1972, Berninis _Savior_ is the first monumental marble bust since antiquity that... [was designed to]...stand free on a pedestal and include both arms. [The figures left hand is tucked beneath the right, its wrist just visible.] It combines, in an unprecedented way for a Christian image, the living and dramatic quality of a narrative figure with the commemorative and idolous quality of a classical bust monument. Turning his head heavenward and raising his right hand in blessing, Berninis Christ proclaims his role as intercessor between God and man, his divine mission as _Salvator Mundi_. Though universal in its spiritual message, the bust remains an intensely personal creation, Berninis very private tribute to the deity on the eye of his own demise. It is Berninis last will and testament as an artist, an embodiment of his faith and hope for salvation. Among the artists preliminary drawings for the _Bust of the Savior_ are a black chalk study of the angels that once supported the bust (Museum der bildenden K√ºnste, Leipzig) and a sheet of black chalk studies of the Saviors head and chest (Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, Rome). A marble copy of the bust, made by an unknown artist at the time of Berninis death, is preserved in the Cathedral at S√©es in France." },

Dominique Ingres Eugene Delacroix Bronze Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046d-f Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

The perspective is in close range, bringing the viewer into an intimate space. Christ is in the center wearing a red robe over a bluish gray tunic. His left hand holds the wrist of the adulterous woman, his right points two fingers at her. She wears an orange dress, the bodice of which is slightly torn open revealing her breast. She wears a thin filmy scarf around her shoulder and over her head. Her eyes are cast downward. To Christs right are two white bearded men, they seem to be in discussion with Christ. The one man in the foreground has a bag of rocks; he clutches one stone behind his back. Each man has a different facial expression as well as distinct features: there are no perfect generic faces, they are all very individual. The man in soldiers garb on Christs left in the foreground looks directly at the viewer, as if suddenly he is aware of being observed.","Height":"29 1/4  in","Width":" 48 in","Artist":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","Artist-Nationality":" German","Artist Birth-Year":"1515","Artist Death-Year":"1586","Object Label":"Lucas Cranach the Younger German, Wittenberg and Weimar (1515-1586) Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, after 1537 Oil on panel Gift of Walter P.

At the Elders death in 1553, Cranach the Younger inherited his busy workshop and carried his fathers style into the late sixteenth century. With its broadly modeled figures and bright colors flatly applied, the schematic design of the painting here typifies the Cranach shop style-a style intended to convey narrative as simply and directly as possible. As told in John 8:2-11, the Pharisees, hoping to trap Jesus in an intellectual double bind, confronted him with an adulterous woman and demanded she be killed for her crime as dictated by the law of Moses. Jesus deflected their challenge by answering, Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone. (That text, in German, is inscribed along the paintings upper edge.) Filled with shame, the defeated Pharisees dispersed. Cranach depicts the storys climax: As the Pharisees clamor for an answer, Christ points compassionately at the adulteress and forgives her sin. Luther himself preached on the theme of Christ and the adulteress, reminding his listeners that any sinner, if repentant, could be forgiven in the kingdom of Christ.","Provenance":"Wesendonck auction, Cologne (Lempertz), Nov. 27, 1935, lot 24, on loan to Bonn, Provinzialmuseum (cat. 1927, nr. 50); Wesendonck collection, Hamburg, Germany; Gsell collection, Vienna, Austria; Schonemon Galleries, NYC; Walter P.

Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at far left, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric.

In the painting, Martha turns in complaint toward Christ, her worldly concerns reflected in her large, well-stocked kitchen.

Chrysler, Jr., 83.586 Reference: Sokolowski, _CM_, 1983, pp. 12-13. Auctioned in London in 1973 from the English parish of All-Hallows-Berkyngechirche-by-the-Tower, this panel is one of the most handsome early Netherlandish paintings to have come to light in recent years. The style of the painting - its meticulous realism and sense of calm, the noble stasis and solidity of its forms which are modeled softly in light - has been attributed to Gerard David, the last of the great fifteenth century artists. Trained quite probably in Haarlem in the northern Netherlands, David moved south to more cosmopolitan Bruges by 1484, the year he joined that citys painters guild. His eclectic, revivalist style, which took much from Jan van Eyck and the other great founders of the Flemish _ars mova_, quickly found favor in Bruges, and after Hans Memlings death in 1494, David became the citys leading painter. In 1501 he was made dean of the Bruges painters guild. _Christ on the Cross between Saints John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi_ has been dated around 1484-92, at the outset of Davids career in Bruges. As Diane Scillia has noted, the figure of Christ -- ultimately Eyckian in inspiration -- follows the design of the crucified Savior in Davids roughly contemporary _Calvary_ painting in Lugano (Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection), while the characterization of Saint John the Baptist recalls the same figure in Memlings _Altarpiece of John Donne_ of ca. 1480 in the National Gallery, London. The painting is not an illustration of the historic movement of the Crucifixion, but a meditative image of Christ on the Cross that transcends time and place. It is a symbol of Christs sacrifice and the promise of salvation that he offers. At left, John the Baptist preaches the advent of Christ: one mightier than I cometh (Luke 3:16). At right, Francis of Assisi (d. 1226), founder of the Franciscan order, displays the stigmata, which symbolize the transforming power of the Christian faith. The message of divine promise -- and of promise fulfilled -- receives triumphant, if delicately understated, expression in the tiny window of the building in the background at left. There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin. The presence of John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi suggests that the work was intended for a chapel dedicated to the veneration of those saints. The distant cityscape -- similar to that in the background of Davids _Nativity_in Budapest (Museum of Fine Arts) and quite possibly a depiction of an actual Flemish town -- may well include the monastery or castle for which the picture was made.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046a-c Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Mentioned, too, as a source of poetic inspriation were the waters of Helicons fountain of Hippocrene, which according to Ovid, gushed forth from the hoofmarks of the winged horse Pegasus. Heemskerck envisions Helicon as an idyllic, tree-shaded paradise, an antique pleasure garden set with statues and littered with books and musical instruments. He alludes to the creation of Hippocrene in an ingenious way, portraying Pegasus as a monumental bronze statue and the fountain as a spray of water issuing from its strut.

A pair are seated at right, and two more join Apollo -- kneeling, with his lyre in hand -- in the central middleground. The remaining Muse has merged with the crowd of pilgrims beyond. A recent study of the paintings underdrawing using infrared reflectography has revealed an interesting detail: Heemskerck initially sketched two bearded, male heads at the extreme left of the composition, where he later chose to paint the standing nude Muse. The High Renaissance image of Apollo and the Muses was perfected in early sixteenth-century Italy, where Raphaels Vatican PARNASSUS fresco of 1510-11 was profoundly influential.

Chief among the sixteenth-century Netherlandish proponenets of Italian style (cf. nos 9, 15) was the Haarlem painter Maerten van Heemskerck. Between 1532 and 1537 he visited Rome, where he made drawings of antique sculpture and architecture and was affected by the late Mannerist aesthetic of the painters Francisco Salviati and Jacopino del Conte. He returned to Haarlem a convert to Italian art and by mid-century had become the most prominent of Italianate painters working in the northern Netherlands. Heemskerck produced mostly relgious images - altarpieces and devotional panels for the Catholic churches of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft. But he also created a remarkable number of mythological and allegorical paintings that revealed his interest in humanistic themes.

Chrysler, Jr. 89.57 Reference: Albert Ch√¢telet, _Early Dutch Painting: Painting in the Northern Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century_, New York, 1981: 233-234, no. 127-A. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the scholar Max J. Friedl√§nder identified a stylistically similar group of paintings and woodcuts that he credited to an unknown late-fifteenth-century Netherlandish artist. He called the painter the Master of the _Virgo inter Virgines_, a pseudonym he derived from one of the artists most famous pictures, the _Virgo inter Virgines_, or _Madonna and Child with Female Saints_, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Since the Masters woodcuts appear in books published in Delft between 1483 and 1498, it is generally assumed that he practiced in that city during the final quarter of the fifteenth century. Scholars have sometimes attempted to identify him with either of two documented Delft painters of the period- Pieter die Maelre or Dirc Jansz- but these identifications remain hypothetical. In his later works the Master devised an eccentric, expressive late Gothic style that recalls the paintings of his contemporaries, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These highly emotional, angst-ridden works are often marked by violently animated figures and unsettling anecdotal details. Even in his somewhat quieter and more austere early works, like the _Crucifixion_ of c. 1480, the Masters expressionism is already apparent in the pungent characterization of his doll-like figures - in the sharply linear rendering of their gaunt, bony forms and disquieting facial features, in the agitated calligraphy of their densely folded draperies. The style and dimensions of the _Crucifixion_ correspond almost exactly to two other panels by the Master, a _Lamentation_ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a _Resurrection_ in Amsterdams Rijksmuseum. It is often suggested that all three panels originally belonged to the same altarpiece, a small Passion polyptych. In this, scholars speculate, the _Crucifixion_ and _Lamentation_ would have functioned together as the centerpiece and the _Resurrection_ as the right shutter. The panel that is presumed to have served as the left shutter has yet to be discovered. In the _Crucifixion_ the weeping holy woman at the far left brings to mind particularly the female figures in the paintings of the Masters Flemish contemporary, Petrus Christus. The armor-clad man at lower right, prayerfully attending the crucified Christ with a hand raised to his heart, seems to have been depicted in a more individualized manner than his neighbors and may portray the paintings donor.

As an artist, he thrived on recording the many gestures and poses of its sinewy ballet dancers, whether adored and elegant in a performance, hard at work in rehearsal, or depleted and anonymous backstage. These often-unglamorous images appear in his paintings, pastels, prints, and sculpture, and constitute at least half of his mature work. In Dancer with Bouquets a prima ballerina stands before a painted backdrop and curtsies to her audience. She raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd. At her feet rest bouquets tossed by her admirers. A harsh glare from the footlights illuminates her figure, revealing her rather inelegant profile and giving the painting a sense of frank immediacy. The same stage lighting gives her diaphanous skirt a gauzy, indistinct appearance so favored by the Impressionists. The heavy lines used to indicate the dancers limbs became more common in Degas work as his eyesight began to fail. Pentimenti-areas of the composition subsequently altered and painted over, yet visible today-can be seen along the contours of the dancers face and arms, indicating that Degas reworked the figure considerably.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1895-1917; the artists family, 1917-1918; Degas sale, Georges Petit, Paris, May 4, 1918; J.

Edgar Degas was most widely known in his lifetime, and is beloved today particularly, as a painter of the dance. Already in 1867, in his _Mlle Fiocre in the Ballet from La Source_ (Brooklyn Museum), he had begun to interpret subjects drawn from the ballet of the Paris Op√©ra. He continued to do so - in hundreds of paintings, sculptures, pastels and prints - for the next forty years. In the nineteenth century the ballet was one of the prime cultural diversions of the Parisian upper class. Degas fascination may have been fostered at an early age by his father, a wealthy Paris banker who was deeply interested in music and surely held a subscription, or _abonnement_, to the Op√©ra. Degas chose for his subjects not merely the seasoned stars of the Op√©ra stage, like the dancer portrayed in The Chrysler Museum picture, but the lesser ranks of the _corps de ballet_ and even the adolescent apprentices, the _petits rats_. He showed dancers in performance, at rest or in transit backstage, and at work in the rehearsal hall, moving their often reluctant bodies through endless hours of exercise at the barre. In the discipline of the dance Degas may have sensed a metaphor for his own lifelong quest for aesthetic control. More important to the Impressionist Degas, however; was the opportunity the ballet offered to research the transitory effects of gesture and motion, the dynamics of human movement. _Dancer with Bouquets_ was produced late in Degas career - around 1895-1900, when his eyesight was failing and he had begun to work in broader, more vigorous strokes. In the painting a prima ballerina takes a bow at the end of a performance: at her feet are bouquets of flowers tossed by an adoring audience. Standing before a painted landscape backdrop, he raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd before her. The footlights, which fill the scene with a magical, if rather harsh, incandescence, transform the gauzy layers of her gown into a smoldering violet-grey cloud. Though painted on a large, official scale - unusual for the late Degas - _Dancer with Bouquets_ was not exhibited during the artists lifetime, but remained in his studio, where it served as a model for other works. The dancers pose was also used in one of Degas later sculptures, _The Bow_ of c. 1896. The _pentimenti_ visible along the contours of the dancers face and arms indicate that Degas reworked her pose considerably. There are at least four preparatory studies for the figure. One, a half-length _√©tude_ in pastel, was included in the second Degas atelier sale in Paris in December of 1918. The remaining three - full-length figure studies in charcoal and pastel and yet another half-length sketch in charcoal - were dispersed in 1919 at the third of the posthumous Degas sales. In _Dancer with Bouquets_ the scene is viewed obliquely, as if from the wings or a private side box. The odd angle of the viewers vantage point and the tricks it plays with perspective and the dancers pose are typical of Degas later, more abstracted compositions. The sharply lighted, unlovely features of the aging dancers face and the sense of motion arrested create and image of nearly photographic frankness and immediacy - an unstudied snapshot of reality stolen from the flow of time.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.716 Drawn from ancient Greek mythology, the pastoral love story of Daphnis and Chlo√´ was a favorite of 19th-century French academic painters. According to the story, the two were thrown together in infancy and nursed by a sheep and cow. They were soon taken in by a shepherd and his wife and spent a carefree childhood together watching over their stepparents flock. They eventually fell in love with each other and married. Vibert depicts the enchanted moment when childhood gives way to the first stirrings of love, as Daphnis teaches Chlo√´ to play the shepherds flute. The event unfolds in an idyllic forest glade carpeted with grass and flowers, an earthly paradise where all is gentleness and innocence. Vibert exhibited the painting in Paris at the 1866 Salon, and though many praised the work, the twenty-six-year-old artist soon abandoned ambitious mythological subjects like Daphnis and Chlo√´ for small-scale scenes of the Catholic clergy. These light-hearted satires of the religious life proved immensely popular, and with them Vibert became one of the best-known artists of the late 19th century.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

According to Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (2:401-465), Diana, the Roman goddess of the chase and protectress of women, required that the nymphs who attended her on her hunts in Arcadia be chaste. One of them, the beautiful Callisto, had the misfortune to catch Jupiters eye while she was hunting alone in the forest. Disguised as Diana, Jupiter came to her and seduced her. Upon her return to Dianas camp, Callisto reluctantly disrobed to bathe along with the other nymphs and was discovered to be pregnant. Enraged at Callistos transgression, Diana drove her away. This dramatic moment of banishment is the subject David Wilkie depicted in his painting of _Diana and Callisto_. A lofty historical subject drawn from classical mythology, the theme of Diana and Callisto was an unusual one for the Scottish-born Wilkie. Moving to London in 1805, he achieved fame there primarily as a portraitist and painter of earthy, humorous genre images like his well-known _Blind Fiddler_ (Tate Gallery, London). But _Diana and Callisto_ was produced at the beginning of Wilkies career, in 1803-04, when the nineteen-year-old artist was still a student at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and had not yet freed himself from the academic interests of his teacher, John Graham. Under Grahams direction, the Academy held a yearly competition among its students for the best history painting. In 1803 the contest subject was Diana and Castillo; Wilkie submitted the present painting and with it won the first prize of nine pounds in early 1804. Wilkie clearly intended to depict the elevated theme of Diana and Callisto in a suitably serious, idealizing style. Nevertheless, there is much in the painting - for example, the powerful and highly individualized facial expressions of Diana and her nymphs - that forecasts the pithy naturalism of the artists mature genre pictures. Writing about _Diana and Callisto_ in 1848, John Burnet remarked that the close observation of nature [in the painting] was apparent, however inappropriate to the higher walks of art....[Callisto] was made to blush with so deep a colour in the ear and upper part of the neck as gave Graham an opportunity...for descanting on the difficulty of introducing the peculiarities of familiar life into the higher branches of art. Wilkies preliminary compositional study for _Diana and Callisto_ rendered in black and red chalk, is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. Jefferson C.

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

The vacationers here are not wealthy folk in elegant seaside attire, but ordinary working people enjoying a day off. Like the other French Neo-Impressionists, Henri Edmond Cross was a political leftist who championed the rights of the laboring classes. In paintings like Excursion he created an idealized vision of French society in which labor, the arts, and leisure combined to form a utopian view of modern life. The young Cross arrived in Paris in 1881 and soon befriended the painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, the first practitioners of Neo-Impressionism. Their deliberate dotted painting technique involved the methodical placement of tiny pinpoints of color. In 1892-a year after Seurats death-Cross and Signac settled in Provence, in the South of France. There, inspired by the vibrant light and radiant hues of the Mediterranean coast, Cross produced his most ambitious works in the Neo-Impressionist style, chief among them Excursion.","Provenance":"Cross atelier sale, Hotel Drouot, Oct. 28, 1921 (cat. no. 27); Dr. Roudinesco, Paris; Walter P.

Chrysler, Jr., 77.416 Reference: Isabelle Compin, _H.E. Cross_, Paris, 1964, pp. 135-136, no. 45. Like his colleague Paul Signac (no. 122), Henri Edmond Cross played a key role in the development of Neo-Impressionism following the death of the movements founder, Georges Seurat, in 1891. Born the son of a Douai ironmonger, Cross arrived in Paris by 1881 to conclude his art studies with the painters Emile Dupont-Zipcy and Fran√ßois Bonvin. As an inaugural member of the progressive Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Cross met Seurat and Signac at the founding of that institution in 1884, though he did not fully adopt their dotted painting method - divisionism - for another seven years (see no. 122). By 1892 both Cross and Signac had left Paris and settled in Provence, Cross at Saint-Clair and Signac at nearby Saint-Tropez. Stimulated by the warming radiance and boisterous colors of the Mediterranean coast, they gradually renounced the constraints of Seurats optical theories and densely granulated brush technique. In a series of light-soaked, arcadian landscapes, they evolved a more vibrant divisionist method, painting in progressively broader blocks of brilliant color. Their research was already well advanced by 1895, as seen in Cross imposing _Excursion_ of that year. In time their style would have a profound influence on the art of the young Henri Matisse and his fellow Fauves (nos. 132, 128), who frequently visited Saint-Tropez around 1904 to study with Signac and Cross. One of Cross most complex figurative landscapes, _Excursion_ depicts a carefree group of summer holiday makers as they relax on a windswept bluff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The paintings arcardian mood evokes the eighteenth-century _f√™tes galantes_ of Antoine Watteau. Its decorative surface patterns - its sweeping curves and arabesques - bring to mind the contemporary work of the Nabis. The subdued color scheme of pink, mauve, green and light blue captures perfectly the sun-bleached palette of Provence. Indeed, Cross noted as he worked on the picture that it would require tints compatible with a sunny plain - not too rich, but more neutral and grey in tone. The _Excursion_ was largely finished by December of 1894, when fellow-divisionist Maximilien Luce mentioned it in a letter to Cross: Signac has told me about a painting of yours that he likes very much (the excursionists); from his description it sounds very interesting. While on display in Paris at the 1895 Salon des Ind√©pendants, the work was viewed by Camille Pissarro (no. 96), who referred to it in an April 8 letter to his son Lucien, and by Signac, who recorded his impressions of it in the April 26 entry of his journal. The painting remained with Cross until his death and was sold at the 1921 auction of his atelier. Three preliminary works survive: a pencil sketch for the standing female figure (Cabinet des dessins, Louvre, Paris), a large compositional study in oil (Petit Palais, Mus√©e dArt Moderne, Geneva) and a smaller oil sketch of the landscape (private collection, Paris).

Like his colleague Bouguereau (no. 87), G√©r√¥me was a standard-bearer of the French academic style, a conservative grand master who carried the hallowed traditions of Davidian classicism into the second half of the nineteenth century. Like Bouguereau, too, he was one of the most influential artists of his day. For a full forty years (1863-1904) he served as a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his impeccable professional credentials drew generations of students, many of the Americans, to his atelier. G√©r√¥me achieved his greatest fame as an interpreter of Orientalist subjects (see nos. 76, 88). In the years after 1853 he traveled repeatedly to North Africa and the Near East - he visited Egypt alone seven times - and he devoted more and more of his art to genre images of Arab life. These works offered a more balanced and realistic portrayal of contemporary Egypt and Arabia than had earlier Romantics like Delacroix (no. 76). However, in the clarity and polish of their brushwork - in their careful crafting of detail and draftsmanly precision - G√©r√¥mes Orientalist pictures remained thoroughly academic. G√©r√¥me made his earliest tour of Egypt in 1856. He spent half of his eight-month visit in Cairo and the other half navigating the Nile, sketching the fabled waterway and its exotic river traffic. Thereafter the Nile became a favored setting for his Egyptian genre pieces, as can be seen in the well-known _Excursion of the Harem_ of 1869, in which a delicate private pleasure craft ferries a sultans seraglio along the river. G√©r√¥me exhibited the painting at the Salon of 1869, where it was warmly received. The Empress Eug√©nie, wife of Napoleon III, hoped to buy it but demurred when told its price - 30,000 francs. After viewing the _Excursion_, the critic Th√©ophile Gautier marveled at its atmospheric and luminary subtleties: The boat slips over the clear transparent water, along the misty shore in a sort of luminous fog which produces a magical effect. The bark seems to float at the same time in the water and in the air....the delicate tones of the land of light are rendered by Monsieur G√©r√¥me with absolute fidelity. A recent cleaning of the painting has once again revealed its luminous palette of mauve and violet hues. The work must also have appealed to the young American Thomas Eakins, who studied with G√©r√¥me from 1866 to 1869 and whose Philadelphia sculling pictures of the early 1870s owe an obvious debt to G√©r√¥mes _Excursion_ and other Egyptian river scenes.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2041A and 71.2041B, respectively Antoine Coysevox was a leading sculptor of Louis XIVs reign and a major interpreter of the Sun Kings Baroque court style. After studying at the Acad√©mie Royale, he was named royal _sculpteur_ in 1666. With the assistance of Louis all-powerful first painter, Charles Le Brun, he was made a professor at the Acad√©mie in 1678. Soon after he joined in the sculptural decoration of Versailles. His subsequent career was one of unbroken ascent. Royal commissions and court requests for portrait busts and statues, for funerary moments and ch√¢teau decorations followed one another in rapid succession, and in 1702 Coysevox was named director of the Acad√©mie. Perhaps the most renowned sculptures of Coysevoxs career were the monumental equestrian marble groups of _Fame_ and _Mercury_ that he produced in 1701-02 for the terrace of the Abreuvoir (horses watering pond) at Louis ch√¢teau at Marly. The pendants, which were moved in 1719 to the Tuileries gardens in Paris, were widely acclaimed. The king rewarded Coysevox with an annual pension of 4000 _livres), the largest yearly stipend he ever granted to an artist in his employ. In the years after 1702 Coysevox and his followers were called upon to issue numerous small replicas in bronze, among them the pair in The Chrysler Museum. Soaring aloft on the winged Pegasus, the female figure of Fame blows upon her horn, while her companion Mercury rides heavenward on his own winged mount. The political import of these allegorical pendants is made clear in the imagery decorating their struts. Each bears a breastplate on which Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, entrusts the female personification of France to Louis XIV. The image underscores Louis absolute power as guardian and ruler of France and his divine right as king. As Pegasus leaps skyward with the trumpeting figure of Fame, it is the kings own ascent to greatness and immortality that is celebrated. As emissary of the gods, Mercury carries the same divinely-sanctioned message heavenward. Jefferson C.

Like many in the group, Dupr√© traveled widely in his search for new subjects. From 1865 he and his family spent the summer months in Cayeux-sur-Mer, a small fishing port on the Channel coast.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2060 Like his older colleagues Charles Vernet-Lecomte, Charles Chaplin, and L√©on Perrault, Jacquet was a standard bearer of the conservative academic-classical style in late-19th-century Paris. A pupil of the French academic master William Bouguereau, he perfected a tight, enameled painting technique which he brought to bear on a range of traditional subjects-portraits, historical costume pieces, sensual female nudes, and sentimental genre images like Girl Minstrel. Between 1864 and his death in 1909, he exhibited his work regularly at the Paris Salon, and by the 1890s he was one of the citys most esteemed and widely known painters. Yet with the triumph of modernist painting in the early 20th century, his reputation rapidly declined, and by the 1920s he was all but forgotten. One of the loveliest of Jacquets works, Girl Minstrel coyly captures the melancholy predicament of a young waif who must fend for herself in a harsh world. Dressed in rags and rough homespun, she holds a hurdy-gurdy, a musical instrument long associated in European art with gypsies and the lower classes. As with the paintings by Chaplin and Perrault nearby, Jacquets sentimental subject is little more than a pretext for presenting a suggestive image of an attractive and vulnerable young girl in need of rescue.

In some instances decoration took the form of figurative scenes drawn from the Bible, illustrating the age-old Christian themes of sin and salvation. In other cases, as with the column capital at left, decoration was more purely ornamental, meant simply to enliven the architecture and give rein to the artists imagination and sense of play. The two male figures crowning the doorway here are too worn to be clearly identified. The figure at right appears to hold a moneybag, perhaps indicating that the door once served as an entrance to a mercantile exchange, or that it illustrated a subject such as the biblical parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Without the sculptural element that initially served as centerpiece-its form sheered away-we are left to speculate about the doors original intent and location.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2063 The provenance (collection history) of Chaplins Ha√Ød√©e is typical of the fate of many French academic paintings in the 20th century and says much about the vagaries of artistic fashion. Celebrated in his day for his paintings of beautiful women and the female nude, Chaplin completed Ha√Ød√©e in 1873 and unveiled it that same year at the Paris Salon. The painting, which coyly depicts the heroine of Lord Byrons epic poem Don Juan, was purchased from the artist by Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, an important New York collector of French painting who in 1887 bequeathed her entire collection, including Ha√Ød√©e, to the newly-founded Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met retained Ha√Ød√©e through the first half of the 20th century, a time when the critical opinion of 19th-century French academic art had begun to slide. With the triumph of the Abstract Expressionists and other American avant-garde artist groups in the mid-1950s, traditional academic art seemed permanently discredited. And in 1956 the Met decided to remove Ha√Ød√©e and scores of other 19th-century pictures from its collection. Soon after, Chaplins painting was auctioned in New York and purchased by Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. Chrysler shrewdly sensed an opportunity in this long-neglected area of the art market and during the 1950s had begun to acquire major examples of 19th-century French academic painting at historically low prices. (He paid $325 for Ha√Ød√©e.) His instincts proved right. By the mid-1970s, French academic art was once more on the rise, and today it represents one of the most active, and lucrative, segments of the international art market.

It is a copy of Salvator Rosas painting of the same title in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. In the foreground are various figures in buccaneer style clothes. They appear to be fishing and talking. At the rocks in the foreground are additional people who appear to be loading or unloading the ships, which are docked beyond the rocks. In the center foreground are a few people in a dory, perhaps also unloading or maybe fishing. Most of the figures wear hats or turbans and some wear bright red clothing, while others wear more neutral browns. At left and center midground are larger ships with their sails down. At right foreground and midground are architectural ruins with tours and arches abounding. From the tops of the ruins grow several trees and other flora to emphasize the decadent state of the buildings. At left midground and background is the water with smaller ships to create the illusion of deep space. There is a town and rocky cliffs at left, which become pale, ghostlike shadows as they disappear into the distance. The horizon line is two-thirds from the top of the canvas. The sky is light blue with numerous puffy, white clouds. In the upper right there are birds in the sky.","Height":" 11 1/2  in","Width":" 15 1/2 in","Artist":"After Salvator Rosa","Artist-Nationality":" Italian","Artist Birth-Year":"1615","Artist Death-Year":"1673","Object Label":"Unknown Artist, possibly Italian (after Salvator Rosa) Harbor Scene with Towers, late 18th or early 19th century Oil on canvas, 11-1/2 x 15-1/2 Gift of Robert E.

In 1733 he moved to Boston, where he established himself as an artisan, working as a glazier and a painter of houses and signs. Around 1740 he began to paint portraits as well. Like many Boston portrait limners of the day, Badger based his simple, forthright style upon the portraiture of John Smibert and Robert Feke and derived many of his compositions from European portrait prints. During the 1750s he was Bostons principal face painter and New Englands best-known artist. After 1760, however, his influence waned rapidly with the emergence of John Singleton Copley and his more sophisticated portrait art (no. 59). During his career Badger painted more than a hundred portraits, many of them likenesses of small children. A mature production of c. 1760, _Jemima Flucker_ possesses that quality of naive charm - the sweetness and fragility - which Badger typically bestowed upon his youngest sitters. The girl is dressed in a blue satin frock trimmed in white and tied loosely at the waist with a pink satin sash. The floral spray in her hair is probably a piece of jewelry, a delicate enamel and silver ornament called a _tremblant_ (a French term that alludes to the fact that the ornament trembled, and shimmered, when the wearer moved). In her right hand she holds a sprig of cherries and on her left, a pet bird. As was often the case when Badger painted children, Jemima Flucker is shown out-of-doors, her full-length form placed directly before the viewer in the foreground of a hilly landscape. The tree that frames the composition at left is almost a Badger signature, a landscape device that occurs throughout his portraiture. A resident of Boston and Cambridge, Jemima Flucker reportedly lived to the age of ninety-five and bequeathed the portrait to her only daughter Elizabeth Child, who was born in 1779. The painting remained in the possession of Jemima Fluckers descendants until 1947. The Chrysler Museum also possesses a letter written by Jemima Flucker to Elizabeth on June 15, 1795. Jefferson C.

Th√©odore Rousseau was a founding member of the Barbizon group of artists (nos. 72, 77, 80, 89, 103, 112) and one of the most esteemed landscape painters in mid-nineteenth-century France. In the late 1820s he was already at work at Chailly, near the Fontainebleau Forest. There, and on subsequent visits to the Auvergne (1830) and Normandy (1831), he produced a revolutionary series of vibrant and spontaneous _plein-air_ landscapes, pure landscapes that dispensed with traditional narrative subject matter and classical compositional schemes. Rousseaus subsequent career in Paris was a constant struggle against the conservative forces of the Salon and Acad√©mie Royale. Between 1836 and 1841 his paintings were consistently rejected by Salon juries, a cruel example of official persecution that earned him the sardonic soubriquet, _le grande refus√©_. In 1841 the frustrated Rousseau turned his back on the Salon, where he did not exhibit again until 1849. The years of rejection had their effect on the artist, who took care after 1850 to produce landscapes more in line with official taste. These composed and carefully worked pictures borrowed much from the landscape art of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. _A Clearing in the Forest of Fontainebleau_, one of several canvases that Rousseau undertook at Barbizon in 1860-62 is an impressive example of his mature, more finished and traditional style. Its composition and the handling of foliage recall particularly the works of the Dutch landscapist Meindert Hobbema. the site depicted may be the _Carrefour de la Reine Blanche_ (The Crossroads of the White Queen), a glade in the forest near Barbizon. The site was a favorite of Rousseaus. Three of his other paintings show the same spot; the best known of these is in the Louvre, Paris. The Chrysler Museum picture conveys the clarity and dewy calm of a spring morning near Barbizon, when the first rays of the rising sun bathe the ancient oaks of Fontainebleau in a golden glow.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2059 In the decades following Napoleons Egyptian campaign (1798-99), Europeans became increasingly fascinated by the rich and still mysterious Islamic cultures of the East, prompting many to travel there for a closer look. In their quest for new and exotic experiences, artists, too, journeyed to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, or Holy Land-a vast, ethnically diverse region that Europeans described simply as the Orient. Returning home, many artists specialized in romantic depictions of Moroccan, Egyptian, and Near Eastern life, fueling the European taste for Orientalist art. The Parisian painter Lecomte-Vernet made the journey at least once, in 1863, and devoted much of his later career to images of beautiful North African women in elaborate, ceremonial dress. His seductive, brilliant-hued Jewess of Morocco is a striking example.","Provenance":"H. Galka, Inc., New York, NY; Walter P. Chrysler, Jr.; Gift of Walter P.

Such paintings were often collaborative efforts. The central figurative scene was typically executed by a history painter adept at figure composition, while the wreath of flowers was supplied by a still-life specialist. The Museums example was painted in Antwerp in 1651 by one of the most inspired of these Flemish collaborative teams: the history painter Erasmus II Quellinus and the still-life specialist Jan Philips van Thielen, both of whom signed the painting. During their 20-year collaboration, Quellinus and Van Thielen produced a number of garland paintings featuring trompe loeil (illusionistic) stone sculptures set in elaborate sculpted frames, or cartouches, and surrounded by flowers. Acquired in London in 1994, the present painting is among the most ambitious of these and also one of the largest; it measures more than four by three feet and is painted on a single sheet of copper measuring less than a quarter of an inch in thickness. At the center Quellinus depicts grisaille (unpainted) sculptures of the Virgin and Infant Christ subduing the serpent. In its mouth the serpent clutches the apple of original sin. Quellinus sets the figures in an elaborate Baroque cartouche crowned at the upper corners with a pair of pelicans. These ancient symbols of selfless love refer to Christs sacrifice on the cross. Van Thielen weaves the cartouche with ivy, an emblem of eternal life through Christ, and a brilliant halo of blooms - roses, jasmine, snow drops, tulips, nasturtium, apple blossoms and anemones, which symbolize the virtues of the Virgin and Child and pay tribute to their holiness. The flowers are enlivened with moths and butterflies, which allude to Christs resurrection. Before the Museum purchased the painting, the collection contained no still life produced before the mid-18th century. Thus, the painting filled a major gap in the collection and enriches the Museums presentation of 17th-century Catholic art and thought.

Moreland_ _1792_ Gift of Morrie A. Moss, 74.5.2 An artistic prodigy, George Morland was already exhibiting drawings at Londons Royal Academy by the age of ten. The elder Morland - a painter and an art dealer who restored Old Master pictures - was cynically aware of the commercial value of his sons precocious talent, and he pushed him to perfect his craft. While apprenticed to his father in 1777-84, the boy was kept perpetually busy. He made drawings for sale and copied the popular landscapes of Joseph Vernet and the Dutch and Flemish paintings that his father restored in his studio. Once free of his father, Morland rejected the strict discipline of his early years and embraced a life of reckless self-indulgence. Despite his increasingly dissolute ways, he produced a remarkable number of pictures. Many of them were cosigned to unscrupulous art dealers who systematically underpaid him and kept him in debt. He died, alcoholic and debt-ridden, at the age of forty-one. During the later 1780s Morland specialized in moralizing genre paintings of upper-middle class life and in fashionable, sentimental pictures of children at play. After 1790 he turned almost exclusively to picturesque scenes of English country life - interiors of stables and landscapes with gypsies, smugglers and peasants. These subjects were determined partly by the Dutch paintings he had first encountered in his fathers shop and partly by the coastal scenes of Vernet and Philipp de Loutherbourg. Influential, too, were the contemporary landscape styles of Thomas Gainsborough (no. 58) and the French rococo masters. With his landscapes Morland forged a vision of rustic English life that affected native artists for generations. The finest works of Morlands uneven career were his country scenes of the early 1790s. Among them is _A View of Westmorland_ of 1792, which reveals the artist at the height of his powers. Here an apparently innocent genre interlude is made the pretext for a stunning evocation of the English coast. The painting depicts a peasant family proceeding toward the shore where two men await them in a boat. The rather anxious, covert glance of the woman suggests that she and her family are actually involved in the not so innocent act of smuggling contraband, an activity often depicted in Morlands landscapes. Though the figures possess the solidity and the mass of seventeenth-century Dutch masters, the landscape itself, evoked in fluid strokes, is a lush tribute to the rococo. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2080 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 16. Gros originally achieved fame in Paris as one of Napoleons principal painters, glorifying the emperor and his military exploits in a series of vast, heroic canvases. In these works he employed a style inspired less by the Neoclassicism of his revered teacher Jacques-Louis David than by the paintings of Rubens (no. 16), which he had studied during his years in Italy (1793-1800). Gros style, with its passionate emotion and vibrant colors, was hailed by the rising generation of French Romantic painters. The most famous of his Napoleonic history paintings, _The Pesthouse at Jaffa_ (Louvre, Paris), was the highlight of the 1804 Salon; with it, Gros reputation was secured. Despite his success, Gros became increasingly worried that he had abandoned the lofty principles of Davids art for what he called the impertinence and vagabondage of Romantic style, and with Davids death in 1825, he sensed the need to return to an art more strictly aligned to the Neoclassicism of his former mentor. This reversion to an older, and no longer fashionable, manner isolated Gros from many of his earlier supporters, and his art became the object of mounting criticism. The crisis came at the 1835 Salon. There Gros exhibited two works of decidedly classical style and subject matter - _Hercules and Diomedes_ (Mus√©e des Augustins, Toulouse) and _Acis and Galatea_, which the artist had painted in Davids memory two years before. The devastating critical response caused Gros to fall into a deep depression, and, soon thereafter, he drowned himself in the Seine. Today Gros is rightly recognized as the crucial link between the austere and learned classicism of his teacher David and the more colorful Romanticism of...Delacroix (Francis Broun). Gros took the mythological subject of _Acis and Galatea_ from a passage in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (13:738-897). In it the nymph Galatea is courted by the hideous Cyclops, Polyphemus, whose love she spurns for that of the shepherd Acis. To proclaim his love, the Cyclops makes music upon his pipes, while Acis and Galatea hide nearby listening. The giant soon spies the pair and, raging with jealousy, crushes Acis beneath a boulder. In Gros painting the terror-stricken lovers, concealed in a cave at waters edge, cower at the approach of Polyphemus, who stalks the countryside blowing his horn. Gros critics balked at the paintings melodramatic tone. They complained, too, that its figures lacked grace, but conceded that they were effectively drawn. In truth, both figures were modeled upon antique sculptural prototypes: Galateas pose recalls that of the so-called Crouching Aphrodite, while Acis suggests the stance of a combative Hercules. The painting and two preliminary drawings (locations unknown) were dispersed during the posthumous sale of Gros studio in November of 1835. In 1863 the picture was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Del√®stre, a former student of Gros who authored the first biography of the artist. Jefferson C.

Crisuolo was Neapolitan. He may have traveled briefly to Rome to copy the works of Raphael and such Mannerist artists as Perino del Vaga.

The Neapolitan school of painting began its rise to international prominence somewhat belatedly, in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Previously Naples had been a provincial art center, its painters influenced and overshadowed by the traditionally more progressive schools of Florence and Rome. As did many of his sixteenth-century colleagues, the Neapolitan Criscuolo no doubt visited Rome. There, his art was transformed by Raphaels High Renaissance paintings and by the Mannerist works of Raphael followers like Perino del Vaga. Returning to Naples, he devised a version of Roman Mannerism that made him one of the mores sophisticated painters in that still parochial center. As his career progressed, Criscuolo - and the Neapolitan school with him - embraced more fully the tenets of the Roman and Florentine high _maniera_ (later Mannerist style), prompted no doubt by visits from itinerant painters like Giorgio Vasari in 1544. A work of Crisculos early post-Roman maturity, the undated _Adoration of the Magi_ has been placed by scholars in the mid-1540s on the strength of its strong stylistic resemblance to the artists 1545 _Adoration with the Trinity_ in the Museo e Gallerie Nazionali di Capodimonte, Naples. In the _Adoration of the Magi_, Criscuolo reshapes the art of Perino del Vaga in more current _maniera_ style, creating an elegant image of self conscious grace, of characteristically compressive _maniera_ forms and surface suavity. The artists essentially two dimensional design is particularly pronounced in the forms of the three kings, which have been flattened against the picture plane in a dense pattern of sinuous line and shifting color and texture. As they present their gifts to the Child, the three kings - the young Moor Balthasar, the middle-aged Melchior and the grey bearded Caspar - proclaim the allegiance of all earthly rulers to the divine King of Kinds. Symbolizing this act of fealty is the crown that the eldest magus has pulled from his head and placed on the steps beneath Christs feet. Its piers crumbling and overgrown with vines, the architectural ruin behind the Holy Family serves as a venerable Christian symbol for the old Jewish law, which was destroyed by the coming of Christ. Though based ultimately on High Renaissance canons, the faces and forms of Virgin and child have been keyed to a sharper _maniera_ pitch and, thus, exhibit a more rarified and eccentric kind of beauty. Remarkable, too, are Criscuolos palette of acidic blues, greens and yellows and the snarling griffin carved from the leg of Christs throne. Criscuolos paintings are rare in American collections, and the _Adoration of the Magi_ offers a unique and exceptionally fine example of provincial Italian response to Roman high style in the mid-sixteenth century.

Scholars believe that Tintorettos Allegorical Figure of Spring is one of the four paintings of seasons that once decorated a Venetian palace described by the seventeenth-century biographer, Carlo Ridolfi: In the Palazzo Barbo at San Pantaleone one sees in the paneling of one room a Capriccio of Dreams with some gods in heaven and various symbols of things that come into the minds of men while they are dreaming; in the surrounding area the Four Seasons are personified. Together with Veronese and the aging Titian, Tintoretto was a presiding master of the Venetian school of painting in the second half of the sixteenth century. The sign over his studio door read the color of Titian, the drawing of Michelangelo. His bold combination of northern and central Italian techniques yielded a passionate and lyrical late Mannerist style that brought him countless private and public commissions in Venice.

Together with Veronese (no. 13) and the aging Titian, Tintoretto presided over the Venetian school of painting during the second half of the sixteenth century. His style was formed by Michelangelo, the Venetian Mannerists and Titian, to whom he may have been apprenticed. From them he forged an art of violent energy and monumental sweep, a passionate late Mannerist style marked by an astonishing technical freedom. Tintoretto and his many assistants worked almost continuously on large-scale commissions for Venetian churches, palaces, charitable confraternities and government buildings, covering acres of wall and ceiling with a feverish velocity that dumbfounded his rivals. As had the classical writers and artists who influenced them so profoundly, sixteenth-century European painters frequently used the cycle of the seasons as a metaphor for the eternal passage of time. Their paintings of the seasons were often produced in sets of four, with each picture featuring a male or female figure who personified the particular season with the help of appropriate seasonal attributes. Following traditional practice, Tintoretto produced his _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ around 1555 as part of a series of four paintings of the seasons. Here, a lively and robust Flora, goddess of flowers and spring, shakes off the torpor of winter. The spray of flowers that seems to issue from her womb shows that she is fertile with the promise of new life. She is a splendid, full-bodied symbol of the generative power of the reawakening earth. Tintorettos companion pictures of _Summer_ and _Winter_ survive: the former is found in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the latter in a private collection in Bergamo. The concluding painting of _Autumn_ has yet to be recovered. The Chrysler Museum and National Gallery paintings were originally fitted with octagonal frames that covered their corners. The seventeenth-century biographer of Venetian artists, Carlo Ridolfi, noted in his _Le Maraviglie dellArte_ (1648) that Tintoretto produced a set of Seasons pictures as part of his decoration of a room in the Barbo Palace in Venice: In the Palazzo Barbo at San Pantaleone one sees in the panelling of one room a Capriccio of Dreams with some gods in heaven and various symbols of things that come into the minds of men while they are dreaming; in the surrounding area the Four Seasons are personified. Scholars have suggested that the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace was a ceiling painting and that it can be identified with a large, octagonal canvas by Tintoretto in the Detroit Institute of the Arts, the so-called _Dreams of Man_. It has also been proposed that the _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ and its three companion paintings are the Four Seasons that originally flanked the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace, composing, perhaps, a frieze of paintings along the tops of the walls.

Some believe that these three men in Italian medieval and Renaissance dress-an architect, a monk, and a poet-are meant to portray specific, famous Italians-possibly the painter and architect Giotto, the Florentine firebrand Savonarola, and the creator of the Divine Comedy, Dante. Others have suggested that the figures should be viewed more broadly as allegorical embodiments of artistic, religious, and poetic inspiration-as personifications of the different aspects of Renaissance genius engaged in a colloquy on the nature of art and the spirit. Puvis painted this tribute to Italian greatness at the age of twenty-four, while visiting Rome in 1848. It was the young artists first major painting, and it clearly reflects his early interest in the robust, romantic art of Thomas Couture and Ary Scheffer. Puvis went on to achieve great fame in France for his large-scale mural paintings. Using an altogether different style marked by a flat, decorative approach to the human figure, he created in these works a pale and silent realm of motionless, columnar forms-a remote world of dreams that enchanted the Symbolists of the 1880s and 1890s. Yet even in early works like Allegory, we can trace the basic features of those mature works-their sense of mystery, gentle poetry, and contemplative calm.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"Signed and inscribed: Rome, 1848.","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr., 71.545 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 41. The marine and landscape specialist Jongkind was, perhaps, the most important precursor of the French Impressionist school. He served as mentor to Eug√®ne Boudin (no. 109) and to the young Claude Monet, whom he encountered in Normandy in the summer of 1862 and impressed greatly with his sparkling _plein-air_ pen sketches and watercolors. From that time on, Monet wrote, he was my real master, and it was to him that I owed the final education of my eye. Born and trained initially in Holland, Jongkind arrived in Paris in 1846 and joined the atelier of the famous marine painter Eug√®ne Isabey. Within a year he was painting along the Normandy and Brittany coasts. He made his debut at the 1848 Salon, and though his works sold well, he was plagued by debts and was often deeply depressed. At his mothers death in 1855, Jongkind suffered a nervous collapse and withdrew to Holland, where he lived for five years as an impoverished semi-recluse. After his return to Paris in 1860, however, his fortunes brightened, largely through the efforts of his enthusiastic patron Th√©ophile Bascle and his new-found companion Josephine Fesser-Borrh√©e. By the mid-1860s Jongkind had reached his creative pinnacle, producing some of the most vibrant and spontaneous of his Pre-Impressionist landscapes. Among these mature works is the 1866 _Along the Ourcq_, which was apparently purchased from the artist by Bascle. The painting depicts the Ourcq canal, which lies just northeast of Paris. Since Mme Fesser-Borrh√©es brother-in-law lived near the canal, in the village of Pantin, Jongkind had ample opportunity to study and paint the waterway and its well-trodden towpaths. The Ourcq was, in fact, one of Jongkinds preferred sites in the mid-1860s, when he sketched and painted it repeatedly under varying atmospheric conditions - in sunlight, in moonlight, in the rain. An 1864 painting of the canal by Jongkind, today in the collection of Paul Mellon (Upperville, Virginia), and a watercolor view from the same year (private collection, Paris) directly anticipate the design of The Chrysler Museum canvas. Jongkind customarily composed his paintings in the studio, consulting sketches he had made _sur le motif_ (on the spot). Thought not painted out-of-doors, _Along the Ourcq_ nonetheless conveys the freshness and freedom of a rapidly executed _plein-air_ impression. These were the very qualities that attracted Monet and, as Boudin said, opened the door through which all the Impressionists passed. Jefferson C.

Others, like the Parisian sculptor Prosper dEpinay, held firm to the traditional tenets of academic classicism. The smooth, idealized forms, meticulously finished surface, and open sentimentality of DEpinays impressive marble group, Amor Forgiven, are typical of the kind of conservative, academic sculpture that dominated the Paris Salon in the final decades of the 19th century. Though this kind of sculpture fell out of fashion with the rise of modernist art in the early 20th century, it has recently returned to favor and is now avidly sought by collectors. Classical mythology is filled with stories about the love goddess Venus and her mischievous winged offspring Cupid, who often disobeyed his mother and aimed his arrows of love at the wrong targets. In DEpinays sculpture, Venus gathers her son in her arms, presumably forgiving him for one of his transgressions. DEpinays lighthearted mythological subject is largely a pretext for a fetching portrayal of a sensual female nude and cherubic child in playful embrace. The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923). By the mid-20th century it was owned by the family of Lydia Aspergren of Norfolk, who donated it to the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences in 1963. Kept largely in storage since then, the sculpture was recently cleaned for exhibit in Behind the Seen. Conservation Project After sitting in storage for decades, DEpinays Amor Forgiven was in need of a thorough surface cleaning. In August of 2005, sculpture conservator Andrew Baxter was contracted to clean the sculpture in time for its exhibition in Behind the Seen. Mr. Baxter began the process by dry cleaning the surface with a vacuum and erasures, removing as much grime as possible before moving on to soap and water. Using swabs and brushes, he next wet-cleaned the surface with a non-ionic soap. To draw out deeply embedded stains, he applied clay poultices to the surface. Once the cleaning process was complete, Mr. Baxter covered the surface with a protective coating of wax.","Provenance":"The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923).

Though celebrated today as one of the earliest and most creative of the Impressionists, the landscapist Sisley enjoyed no such recognition during his lifetime. From the early 1870s, when he began to paint professionally, until his death in 1899, he practiced his art in poverty and obscurity, struggling in vain against a hostile public and indifferent press. A Parisian by birth, Sisley entered the atelier of Charles Gleyre (no. 100) in 1862 and there befriended fellow students Claude Monet, Fr√©d√©ric Bazille and Renoir (no. 113). Within months the four young artists had departed from Gleyres studio for Chailly-en-Bi√®re and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There, through their communal experiments with _plein-air_ painting, they sowed the first seeds of Impressionism, and by 1870 Sisleys landscapes had begun to exhibit the clear, high-keyed tones and sketchy, broken color touches of the new style. Though his later landscapes displayed the formal disintegrations inherent in the Impressionist technique, Sisley remained committed to an art of compositional and spatial clarity, to architectonically structured landscapes and carefully calibrated perspectives. Sisley spent most of his life working in the villages and countryside around Paris. Initially he lived in or near Louveciennes (1871-74), Marly-le-Roi (1875-77) and S√®vres (1877-79) and showed a special interest in river and snow scenes. In later years (1880-99) he resided near Fontainebleau in the hamlets of Veneux-Nadon and neighboring Moret, at the juncture of the Seine and Loing rivers, where he repeatedly painted the banks of these waterways and the adjacent fields. Produced at the onset of his final Moret period, _Apple Trees in Flower_ of 1880 portrays the crisp, breezy weather of early spring, when the chill of winter still lingers on the land. Its forms merely summarized by Sisleys dappling, Impressionist brush, the landscape is brought into structural focus through the anchoring verticals of the blossoming fruit trees. The receding lines of the trees also create a sense of deep space, a characteristic feature of Sisleys art. Sisley relished the challenge of capturing the transitory effects of light and weather and the fleeting magic of seasonal change. In an enthusiastic letter written from Moret in the spring of 1883, he reported: The weather has been wonderful. I have started work again, but unfortunately, because it has been such a dry spring, the fruit trees are not flowering all at once, and the blossoms are dropping very quickly.

Fromentin possessed remarkably varied artistic talents. He achieved fame not only as a painter, but as a travel writer, novelist, and art critic. After devoting his youth to the study of law, he resolved to become an artist and in 1844 began his training in Paris with the landscape painter Louis Cabat. A fleeting visit to Algeria in 1846 confirmed his growing interest in romantic, Orientalist themes (see nos. 76, 99). When two of his North African pictures were applauded at the 1847 Salon in Paris - his public debut - he returned to Algeria for a longer stay. By 1850 Fromentin was well-known in France as a leading Orientalist painter, and his final Algerian sojourn of 1852-53 provided enough material to sustain him in this genre for the rest of his life. Fromentins passionate interest in North Africa inspired him to write two travel accounts, _A Summer in the Sahara_ and _A Year in the Sahel_, in the later 1850s. In 1862 his famous novel _Dominique_ appeared in print, and just before his untimely death at age fifty-five, he issued his treatise on Dutch and Flemish painting, _Les Ma√Ætres dautrefois_, which is viewed today as one of the most significant pieces of art criticism produced in the nineteenth century. Displayed at the 1863 Salon, The Chrysler Museum painting captures one of Fromentins favorite and most picturesque subjects - the nomadic Arab plainsman astride his coursing steed. Here a falconer on the hunt races before his comrades, clutching in his upraised hand a perch and the leather leashes holding his birds of prey. Fromentins Salon offerings elicited almost unanimously positive reactions from conservative critics and the public, and the _Arab Falconers_ was especially well received. The critic Paul Mantz, for example, marveled at the spirited conception of the horseman, who seemed bewitched by the seductions of the chase. The figure...is full of movement and wild energy. Others praised the artists fluid handling of the brush, which bathes the paintings surface in veils of liquid color. Many European artists of the day viewed the Arab plainsman as an uncorrupted child of Nature, a heroic Noble Savage whose life was still intimately tied to the rhythms and pulse of nature. Fromentin endorses this romanticized view in the _Arab Falconer_, in which the hunter seems as fierce and wild as his mount and birds of prey. The great popularity of the painting encouraged Fromentin to repeat its composition, in mirror image, one year later in a picture now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

In the decades following Napoleons Egyptian campaign of 1798-99, the mysteries of the Islamic East were gradually revealed to a fascinated public in France. Questing for novel and exotic experiences, many Romantic artists began to journey to Morocco, Egypt and the Holy Land. There they discovered new subjects for genre paintings in the Oriental cultures of North Africa and the Near East (see also nos. 88, 99). Among the first, and by far the most important, of these French artist-travelers was Delacroix. In 1832 he joined the Comte de Mornay on a diplomatic mission sent by the French government to the sultan of Morocco. Though his visit lasted only six months, it transformed his art. Delacroix was so impressed by the brilliant sunlight and vivid colors of the North African desert and so intrigued by the dignity of Arab life that he devoted much of his later career to Orientalist pictures like the 1851 _Arab Horseman Giving a Signal_. For Romantic artists the horse became a symbol of their restless and passionate souls. Delacroix was fascinated by these creatures, by their nervous beauty and untamed energy. By the end of his life he had devoted more than 150 works - paintings, drawings and watercolors - to equine subjects, and in many of them he captured the splendid wildness of a galloping or rearing steed.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.517 Millet was the leader of the Barbizon School, the group of French landscape and genre painters who abandoned Paris around 1850 to work in the village of Barbizon and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There Millet and his Barbizon colleagues produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes -among them, Babys Slumber- that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants. The simplicity and directness of these pictures helped shape the new Realist style that surfaced in French art in the mid-nineteenth century. Babys Slumber depicts the interior of a peasant cottage bathed in soft summer light. In it a young woman busies herself with domestic chores -sewing and mending- while with her foot she rocks her sleeping child in its cradle. Visible through the open window, a man -presumably her husband- works in the garden beyond. Millets vision of maternal devotion and domestic harmony in the countryside serves as a tribute to the timeless virtues of the French peasantry -patience, diligence, perseverance- and to the dignity and continuity of life on the land.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1855-1861; probably Alfred Sensier, Paris, 1861; S.F.

Within a decade he had become a leader of the small, but influential group of landscape and genre painters that had assembled in that tiny village near the Fontainebleu Forest (nos. 72, 77, 86, 103, 112). There, inspired by seventeenth-century Dutch painting and warm recollections of his peasant upbringing in Normandy, Millet produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes - among them _Babys Slumber_ of c. 1855 - that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants (see also nos. 81, 89). The humble naturalism of these pictures - their naive directness of vision (Robert Herbert) - helped shape the new Realist aesthetic that surfaced in French painting in the mid-nineteenth century. While at Barbizon, Millet instructed a number of younger American painters, who helped to popularize his work in the United States, particularly in Boston. Among them was the Boston artist Edward Wheelwright, who came to Barbizon to study with Millet in October, 1855. Wheelwright stayed on until the following spring and published his recollections in 1876 in the _Atlantic Monthly_; one of the noteworthy events he recounted was his viewing of _Babys Slumber_. Not long after Millet had finished the picture, Wheelwright and several other painters visited his studio while he was away in Paris on business. Inspecting his canvases one by one, they happened upon the painting: At last was brought out from its hiding place a picture representing the interior of a peasants cottage. A young mother was seated, knitting or sewing, while with one foot she rocked the cradle in which lay a child asleep....Anything more exquisitely beautiful than this sleeping child has rarely, I believe, been painted. Through the open window the eye looked out into a garden where a man with his back turned appeared to be at work. The whole scene gave the impression of a hot summers day; you could almost see the trembling motion of the heated air outside, you could almost smell the languid scent of flowers, you could almost hear the droning of the bees, and you could positively feel the absolute quiet and repose, the solemn silence, that pervaded the picture. All those at least felt it who saw the picture upon that...morning. A sudden hush fell upon all the noisy and merry party....The silence that was in some way painted into the canvas seemed to distill from it into the surrounding air. To give depth and resonance to his genre images, Millet frequently alluded to biblical or classical themes. _Babys Slumber_ suggests the domestic harmony of the Holy Family, a parallel that lends an air to sacredness to this modest peasant scene.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.650 Reference: Yale, 1987-88, no. 11. The iridescent color schemes and illusionistic designs of late Baroque decoration were first championed in Naples by Luca Giordano. He was the unrivaled leader of the Neapolitan school of painting during the second half of the seventeenth century and one of the most influential of contemporary European artists. His extraordinary speed and productivity as a painter were legendary. Colleagues called him the Thunderbolt and _Luca fa presto_. Equally dazzling was his capacity to imitate the works of other artists. His boundless talent for creative mimicry was first honed by his father Antonio, a Neapolitan painter and copyist, and in time it earned him the nickname Proteus. For Giordano, the decades after 1650 were marked by almost constant travel - to Florence, Venice, Rome and eventually to Spain. Already by 1660 he had abandoned the dark, Caravaggesque style of Jusepe de Ribera, quite possibly one of his teachers, for a lighter, more colorful late Baroque manner derived from Pietro da Cortonas Roman works and those of the great sixteenth-century Venetians. The Chrysler Museum painting is one of at least three pictures by Giordano (Museo del Castelvecchio, Verona; Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden) that illustrate the mythology of Bacchus and Ariadne. A fluent work of full maturity, it has been dated to Giordanos Florentine sojourn of 1685-86. The dating is based on its strong stylistic kinship to the artists contemporary frescos in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, and particularly to the Medici-Riccardi _Triumph of Bacchus_. As recounted in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (8:170-182) and other classical sources, Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, helped her beloved Theseus escape the Labyrinth and then sailed with him to the island of Naxos, where he deserted her. Heartbroken at her abandonment, she was discovered on the shore by Bacchus, god of wine, who fell in love with her and, after his voyage to India, returned to marry her. He then placed her marriage crown in the heavens, where it was transformed into a constellation, the corona borealis. In Giordanos painting a love-smitten Bacchus and his celebrants -- maenads, satyrs, putti -- encounter Ariadne for the first time, stealing up on her as she slumbers sadly at waters edge. Ariadnes future betrothal is forecast in the crown of stars that hovers above her. The paintings stately tone and cool palette of silvery pinks and blues evoke Poussin and Titian, while the striding figure of Bacchus pays homage specifically to Titians _Bacchus and Ariadne_ in the National Gallery, London. In Ariadnes pose the inspired mimic Giordano presents a witty reprise of Michelangelos sculpture of _Night_from the Tomb of Guiliano deMedici (San Lorenzo, Florence). Jefferson C.

In the art academies of eighteenth-century Europe, painters of historical and religious themes (see nos. 47, 52) were valued far more highly than those who devoted themselves to the minor subjects of genre, landscape, and still life. Yet, the most inspired interpreters of the minor subjects could achieve considerable fame in their lifetimes and genuine immortality in the annals of art history. One such genius was Chardin, who was among the most revered painters of still life and genre in mid-eighteenth-century Paris. Championed particularly by the influential philosopher and art critic Denis Diderot (d. 1784), Chardin enjoyed both official and popular success. He was an honored member of the Acad√©mie Royale and a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon, and his paintings were avidly collected by a newly affluent French middle class. In his later still lifes, Chardin abandoned his earlier interest in the meticulous delineation of texture and detail and concentrated on more profound visual elements. Color and volume, half-light and highlight, the broad compositional interplay of solid and void - these became the underlying concerns of his mature still lifes such as the _Basket of Plums_. When the painting - or its replica, which is located today in a private French collection - was shown by Chardin at the 1765 Salon, Diderot described it briefly in his commentaries on the exhibition: ...placed on a stone bench, a wicker basket full of plus, for which a paltry string serves as a handle, and scattered around it some walnuts, two or three cherries and a few small bunches of grapes [in truth, white currants]. Though the arrangement is typically spare, the effect on the eye is magical. The luscious mound of purple and rosy red plums smolders in the shadowy light. The currants gleam like pearls. What emerges from this humble assembly of fruits and nuts, and from the velvety brushwork that informs it, is a vision of the poetic essence of objects that dazzled Chardins contemporaries and captivates us perhaps even more today.

A major influence on early twentieth-century modernism, C√©zanne labored to restore structure and intellectual control to painting following the era of Impressionism. I want to make of Impressionism something solid, he once proclaimed, like the art of the Museums. In his mature paintings of the 1880s and 1890s, and particularly in his later landscapes and still lifes, C√©zanne portrayed the visible world as an architectonic interlocking of colors and simple, reductive forms, a tight and permanent semiabstraction that would in time inspire the Cubism of Picasso and Braque (no. 139). C√©zannes mature, Post-Impressionist style began to emerge after 1872, when his encounters with Camille Pissarro (no. 96) rapidly transformed his art. Before that time, the young painter had worked in an altogether different style, a blunt and brooding Romantic mode full of dark energy and often violent emotion. This early style, which scholars have only recently begun to research in depth, is revealed to spectacular effect in _Bather and Rocks_ of c. 1860-66. C√©zanne initially divided his time between his native Provence and Paris, where his paintings were consistently refused by the Salon and ridiculed by the critics at the Impressionist exhibits of 1874, 1876 and 1877. After 1877 he secluded himself more and more in Provence - at LEstaque and in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence - and there lived the life of a misanthropic recluse. He often worked in these years at the Jas de Bouffan, his familys country estate on the outskirts of Aix. C√©zannes father, a hard-nosed banker who had little patience for his sons artistic aspirations, purchased the seventeenth-century mansion of the Jas de Bouffan in 1859. Soon after, he reluctantly agreed to let C√©zanne have a studio there. During the following decade he also allowed his son to decorate the grand salon of the Jas de Bouffan with murals of his own design. These large-scale paintings, which C√©zanne executed in oil directly on the plaster walls of the room, are among the most ambitious of his early works. They included two large landscape murals, painted in 1860-62. Probably after his visit to Paris in 1862-64, C√©zanne added the figure of a massively-muscled male nude seen from behind to one of these landscapes - a rocky vista with pine trees and a rushing stream. This _Landscape with Bather_ remained _in situ_ and intact until 1907, the year after C√©zannes death. At that time Louis Granel, who had purchased the house from the artist in 1899, had most of the murals detached from the walls, transferred to canvas and readied for sale. The only portion of the _Landscape with Bather_ that was removed from the wall (and saved from destruction) was the nude male figure - i.e., the _Bather and Rocks_ that is today in The Chrysler Museum. The design and dorsal presentation of C√©zannes nude were clearly influenced by Gustave Courbet, as can be seen, for example, from Courbets 1853 painting of _The Bathers_ in the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier. However, the style of C√©zannes figure - its turbulent brush technique and heavy, black contours - more closely recalls the passionate Romantic art of Delacroix (no. 76). Jefferson C.

Born in Honfleur, the landscape and marine painter Boudin was the son of a Norman ships captain. In his mature pictures he repeatedly portrayed the grand sweep of sea and sky along the French Atlantic coast. Though his first years as a painter were not easy, Boudin remained true to his brisk _plein-air_ technique, and in 1858, at Rouelles in Normandy, he began to teach the young Claude Monet how to paint out-of-doors. The budding Impressionist was soon entranced by the directness of Boudins approach and by his ability to capture the ever-changing qualities of natures light and atmosphere. If I have become a painter, Monet later said, I owe it to Eug√®ne Boudin. Boudins role as mentor to Monet - a role later assumed by Johan Jongkind (no. 95) - confirmed his position as one of Frances most important Pre-Impressionist painters. Boudin received his first recognition in the mid-1860s with his now-famous Trouville and Deauville beach scenes. Executed _en plein air_ with a revolutionary fluidity and dash, these small paintings of fashionable Second-Empire vacationers at seaside were applauded at the Salon in Paris and laid the groundwork for his subsequent success. In later productions like _Beached Boats at Berck_ - an unusually large landscape for Boudin - the artist somewhat tempered his early style with a more deliberate, descriptive realism. The site depicted in the painting is the shore at Berck-sur-Mer, a small village along the English Channel between Dieppe and Calais. Boudin had already visited Berck in 1874, five years before he produced the picture. In the painting, Norman fishermen rest in the humid haze of a summer afternoon, their boats temporarily beached by the receding tide. Some of the fishermen repair their craft, while others take their midday meal. The vast canopy of cloud-filled sky is masterfully portrayed, confirming Corots salute to Boudin as the king of skies. The Impressionists were fascinated by Boudins ability to evoke specific kinds of weather and times of day. So, too, were the critics. One can guess the very season, the time of day, and the wind in Boudins work, marveled Charles Baudelaire in his account of the 1859 Salon. Jefferson C.

Independent and strong-willed, Bonheur ignored the limitations placed on academic training for women and instead taught herself art. She made life studies of farm animals-horses, bull, cows-and copied earlier animal paintings found in the Louvre. She studied animal anatomy in the citys slaughter-houses and even dissected animals at the National Veterinary Institute. Her efforts bore fruit in 1855, when her monumental Horse Fair (see illustration) brought her international acclaim. Like Harriet Hosmer in Rome, Bonheur cut an eccentric figure in Paris, favoring female companions, mens clothes, and cigarettes. When challenged on her unconventional wardrobe, she merely claimed it simplified her field work with animals: I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my sex was a constant bother. This is why I solicited the authorization to wear mens clothing from the prefect of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire, and nothing else.

The Bust of the Savior was his last work, carved by his own hand at the age of eighty in spiritual preparation for his imminent death. He willed it to his friend and patron, Christina, Queen of Sweden, Romes preeminent Catholic convert. Bernini created a majestic Christ, his head turned heavenward to intercede between God and humankind: the Salvador Mundi (Savior of the World) raises his right hand in eternal blessing. The gesture also alludes to Christs metamorphosis from mortal to divine being. After Christs resurrection and before his ascension into heaven he took care that his body remain undefiled. Noli Me Tangere, he commanded, with his right hand raised. Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). Bernini designed an elaborate seven-foot-high pedestal to support the sculptures base. Viewed from below and at a distance, Christs elongated and exaggerated features would have appeared slightly foreshortened and softened. Sculpted kneeling angels were to support the marble Christ. Roman Catholics would have associated this elevated image of the Savior with the priests Elevation of the Host during Mass (the celebration of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion).","Provenance":"The artist, 1679-1680; Queen Christina of Sweden, Rome, 1680-1689; Pope Innocent XI, Odescalchi, 1689; The Palazzo Odescalchi, 1713; Vicomte Jacques de Canson, Paris, 1952; Walter P.

Bernini was the greatest sculptor and architect of the seventeenth century and the major founder of Italian High Baroque style. An artistic demigod who dominated the Roman art world for more than fifty years, he was courted by kings and popes throughout his career. At the time of his death - he succumbed to a stroke in Rome in 1680 - he was revered throughout Europe. Bernini began the marble _Bust of the Savior_ in 1679, only a year before his death. Both of his early biographers, Filippo Baldinucci (1682) and Berninis son Domenico (1713), discuss the work at length. They record that the artist intended to present the bust - his final work - as a gift to his dear friend and ardent supporter, Queen Christina of Sweden, who was then living in Rome. Baldinucci writes: Bernini was already in the eightieth year of his life. For some time past he had been turning his most intense thoughts to attaining eternal repose rather than to increasing his earthly glory. Also, deep within his heart was the desire to offer, before closing his eyes to this life, some sign of gratitude to Her Majesty the Queen of Sweden, his most special patron. In order, therefore, to penetrate more deeply into the first concept and to prepare himself better for the second, he set to work with the greatest intensity to create in marble a half -length figure, larger than life-size, of Our Savior Jesus Christ. This is the work that he said was his favorite and it was the last given to the world by his hand. According to Baldinucci, Christina refused the gift in a moment of royal self-deprecation: The Queens opinion of, and esteem for, the statue was so great that, not finding herself in circumstances in which it was possible to give a comparable gift in exchange, she chose to reject it rather than fail in the slightest degree to equal the royal magnificence of her intention. Bernini then bequeathed the bust to her, and, at Christinas death in 1689, it passed to Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi, in whose family it remained at least until 1713, when it was mentioned in an inventory of the Palazzo Odescalchi. By then the sculpture had achieved considerable fame, having been chosen as the official emblem of the Apostolic Hospital in Rome. An early description of the bust states that it originally stood atop an elaborate and richly ornamented pedestal that rose more than seven feet from the floor. Constructed from Berninis own design, the pedestal was composed of a gilded wooden socle, stepped at the top, that supported a pair of kneeling angels, also in gilded wood. The angels, in turn, upheld the bust on a base of Sicilian jasper. As Irving Lavin noted in 1972, Berninis _Savior_ is the first monumental marble bust since antiquity that... [was designed to]...stand free on a pedestal and include both arms. [The figures left hand is tucked beneath the right, its wrist just visible.] It combines, in an unprecedented way for a Christian image, the living and dramatic quality of a narrative figure with the commemorative and idolous quality of a classical bust monument. Turning his head heavenward and raising his right hand in blessing, Berninis Christ proclaims his role as intercessor between God and man, his divine mission as _Salvator Mundi_. Though universal in its spiritual message, the bust remains an intensely personal creation, Berninis very private tribute to the deity on the eye of his own demise. It is Berninis last will and testament as an artist, an embodiment of his faith and hope for salvation. Among the artists preliminary drawings for the _Bust of the Savior_ are a black chalk study of the angels that once supported the bust (Museum der bildenden K√ºnste, Leipzig) and a sheet of black chalk studies of the Saviors head and chest (Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, Rome). A marble copy of the bust, made by an unknown artist at the time of Berninis death, is preserved in the Cathedral at S√©es in France." },

Dominique Ingres Eugene Delacroix Bronze Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046d-f Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

She wears a thin filmy scarf around her shoulder and over her head. Her eyes are cast downward. To Christs right are two white bearded men, they seem to be in discussion with Christ. The one man in the foreground has a bag of rocks; he clutches one stone behind his back. Each man has a different facial expression as well as distinct features: there are no perfect generic faces, they are all very individual.

At the Elders death in 1553, Cranach the Younger inherited his busy workshop and carried his fathers style into the late sixteenth century. With its broadly modeled figures and bright colors flatly applied, the schematic design of the painting here typifies the Cranach shop style-a style intended to convey narrative as simply and directly as possible. As told in John 8:2-11, the Pharisees, hoping to trap Jesus in an intellectual double bind, confronted him with an adulterous woman and demanded she be killed for her crime as dictated by the law of Moses. Jesus deflected their challenge by answering, Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone. (That text, in German, is inscribed along the paintings upper edge.) Filled with shame, the defeated Pharisees dispersed. Cranach depicts the storys climax: As the Pharisees clamor for an answer, Christ points compassionately at the adulteress and forgives her sin. Luther himself preached on the theme of Christ and the adulteress, reminding his listeners that any sinner, if repentant, could be forgiven in the kingdom of Christ.","Provenance":"Wesendonck auction, Cologne (Lempertz), Nov. 27, 1935, lot 24, on loan to Bonn, Provinzialmuseum (cat. 1927, nr. 50); Wesendonck collection, Hamburg, Germany; Gsell collection, Vienna, Austria; Schonemon Galleries, NYC; Walter P.

Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at far left, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric.

The painting was originally paired with a pendant image of the Virgin Mary in her role as Mater Dolorosa, the sorrowing Mother of Christ. Immensely popular among the Catholic faithful, such modest devotional diptychs (two-part altarpieces) stressed the accessibility and human nature of the Madonna and her suffering Son and were generally intended for private meditation and prayer. The figure is set against a gold ground-an eternal, spiritualized backdrop that underscores the figure as a holy icon abstracted from a specific time or place. The emphasis on Christs suffering-his open wounds and tear-streaked face-is picked up even in the gold ground, which is dotted with hundreds of tiny touches of blood-red paint.

On Christs left is St. Francis of Assisi, tonsured head, robed in brown, holding both his hands up to reveal his stigmata. At the base of the cross, in the center foreground are rocks, detailed in painting. The background presents a 15th century Flemish landscape, detailed such that the viewer can see the people in the window of the house just above John the Baptists right hand. In the far distance, the colors fade because of atmospheric perspective; however, more buildings and treed landscapes are visible.","Height":" 26 1/2  in","Width":" 16 3/4 in","Artist":"Attributed to Gerard David","Artist-Nationality":" Netherlandish","Artist Birth-Year":"1460","Artist Death-Year":"1523","Object Label":"Flemish, late 15th century Christ on the Cross Between Saints John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi Oil on panel Gift of Walter P.

The thirteenth-century Saint Francis, founder of the Franciscan order of monks, at right, embodies the transforming power of faith as he displays the stigmata he miraculously received in imitation of Christs wounds on the cross. The paintings promise of salvation through Christs sacrifice is echoed in a tiny window of the building in the left background. There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin.

Chrysler, Jr., 83.586 Reference: Sokolowski, _CM_, 1983, pp. 12-13. Auctioned in London in 1973 from the English parish of All-Hallows-Berkyngechirche-by-the-Tower, this panel is one of the most handsome early Netherlandish paintings to have come to light in recent years. The style of the painting - its meticulous realism and sense of calm, the noble stasis and solidity of its forms which are modeled softly in light - has been attributed to Gerard David, the last of the great fifteenth century artists. Trained quite probably in Haarlem in the northern Netherlands, David moved south to more cosmopolitan Bruges by 1484, the year he joined that citys painters guild. His eclectic, revivalist style, which took much from Jan van Eyck and the other great founders of the Flemish _ars mova_, quickly found favor in Bruges, and after Hans Memlings death in 1494, David became the citys leading painter. In 1501 he was made dean of the Bruges painters guild. _Christ on the Cross between Saints John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi_ has been dated around 1484-92, at the outset of Davids career in Bruges. As Diane Scillia has noted, the figure of Christ -- ultimately Eyckian in inspiration -- follows the design of the crucified Savior in Davids roughly contemporary _Calvary_ painting in Lugano (Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection), while the characterization of Saint John the Baptist recalls the same figure in Memlings _Altarpiece of John Donne_ of ca. 1480 in the National Gallery, London. The painting is not an illustration of the historic movement of the Crucifixion, but a meditative image of Christ on the Cross that transcends time and place. It is a symbol of Christs sacrifice and the promise of salvation that he offers. At left, John the Baptist preaches the advent of Christ: one mightier than I cometh (Luke 3:16). At right, Francis of Assisi (d. 1226), founder of the Franciscan order, displays the stigmata, which symbolize the transforming power of the Christian faith. The message of divine promise -- and of promise fulfilled -- receives triumphant, if delicately understated, expression in the tiny window of the building in the background at left. There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin. The presence of John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi suggests that the work was intended for a chapel dedicated to the veneration of those saints. The distant cityscape -- similar to that in the background of Davids _Nativity_in Budapest (Museum of Fine Arts) and quite possibly a depiction of an actual Flemish town -- may well include the monastery or castle for which the picture was made.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046a-c Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.479 Painted by the artist toward the end of his career, the 1565 CONCERT OF APOLLO AND THE MUSES ON MOUNT HELICON confirms Heemskercks enduring devotion to mythological subjects in the Italian mode. Already in ancient Greek literature of the eighth century B.C. -- and particularly in Hesiods Theogony -- Greeces Mount Helicon was identified as the sacred abode of the nine goddesses of poetry and song, the Muses. There, joined sometimes by Apollo -- the god of music -- the Muses danced, sang and inspired mortal singers and poets with their music and sprigs of laurel. Mentioned, too, as a source of poetic inspriation were the waters of Helicons fountain of Hippocrene, which according to Ovid, gushed forth from the hoofmarks of the winged horse Pegasus. Heemskerck envisions Helicon as an idyllic, tree-shaded paradise, an antique pleasure garden set with statues and littered with books and musical instruments. He alludes to the creation of Hippocrene in an ingenious way, portraying Pegasus as a monumental bronze statue and the fountain as a spray of water issuing from its strut. The two male figures standing at right are poets who have received inspiration and been crowned with laurel. Other mortal pilgrims promenade, pick flowers or bathe in Hippocrenes inspiring waters, while above them putti hover, waiting to bestow more crowns of laurel. With an informality typical of the age, Heemskerck chooses not to identify the Muses by their traditional attributes. So casual is his approach that it is difficult even to locate all nine of the goddesses. Four of them have gathered to sing and make music at the positive organ at left, its bellows worked by a mischievous putto. A pair are seated at right, and two more join Apollo -- kneeling, with his lyre in hand -- in the central middleground. The remaining Muse has merged with the crowd of pilgrims beyond. A recent study of the paintings underdrawing using infrared reflectography has revealed an interesting detail: Heemskerck initially sketched two bearded, male heads at the extreme left of the composition, where he later chose to paint the standing nude Muse. The High Renaissance image of Apollo and the Muses was perfected in early sixteenth-century Italy, where Raphaels Vatican PARNASSUS fresco of 1510-11 was profoundly influential. By the 1540s, French and Flemish artists had also begun to interpret the subject. Among contemporary north Netherlandish painters, Heemskerck seems to have been the principal champion of the theme. In 1549 he designed an etching of APOLLO AND THE MUSES and around 1555 returned to the subject in a painting today in the New Orleans Museum of Art.

Chief among the sixteenth-century Netherlandish proponenets of Italian style (cf. nos 9, 15) was the Haarlem painter Maerten van Heemskerck. Between 1532 and 1537 he visited Rome, where he made drawings of antique sculpture and architecture and was affected by the late Mannerist aesthetic of the painters Francisco Salviati and Jacopino del Conte. He returned to Haarlem a convert to Italian art and by mid-century had become the most prominent of Italianate painters working in the northern Netherlands. Heemskerck produced mostly relgious images - altarpieces and devotional panels for the Catholic churches of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft. But he also created a remarkable number of mythological and allegorical paintings that revealed his interest in humanistic themes. Painted by the artist towards the end of his career, the 1565 _Concert of Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helicon_ confirms Heemskercks enduring devotion to mythological subjects in the Italian mode.

Chrysler, Jr. 89.57 Reference: Albert Ch√¢telet, _Early Dutch Painting: Painting in the Northern Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century_, New York, 1981: 233-234, no. 127-A. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the scholar Max J. Friedl√§nder identified a stylistically similar group of paintings and woodcuts that he credited to an unknown late-fifteenth-century Netherlandish artist. He called the painter the Master of the _Virgo inter Virgines_, a pseudonym he derived from one of the artists most famous pictures, the _Virgo inter Virgines_, or _Madonna and Child with Female Saints_, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Since the Masters woodcuts appear in books published in Delft between 1483 and 1498, it is generally assumed that he practiced in that city during the final quarter of the fifteenth century. Scholars have sometimes attempted to identify him with either of two documented Delft painters of the period- Pieter die Maelre or Dirc Jansz- but these identifications remain hypothetical. In his later works the Master devised an eccentric, expressive late Gothic style that recalls the paintings of his contemporaries, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These highly emotional, angst-ridden works are often marked by violently animated figures and unsettling anecdotal details. Even in his somewhat quieter and more austere early works, like the _Crucifixion_ of c. 1480, the Masters expressionism is already apparent in the pungent characterization of his doll-like figures - in the sharply linear rendering of their gaunt, bony forms and disquieting facial features, in the agitated calligraphy of their densely folded draperies. The style and dimensions of the _Crucifixion_ correspond almost exactly to two other panels by the Master, a _Lamentation_ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a _Resurrection_ in Amsterdams Rijksmuseum. It is often suggested that all three panels originally belonged to the same altarpiece, a small Passion polyptych. In this, scholars speculate, the _Crucifixion_ and _Lamentation_ would have functioned together as the centerpiece and the _Resurrection_ as the right shutter. The panel that is presumed to have served as the left shutter has yet to be discovered. In the _Crucifixion_ the weeping holy woman at the far left brings to mind particularly the female figures in the paintings of the Masters Flemish contemporary, Petrus Christus. The armor-clad man at lower right, prayerfully attending the crucified Christ with a hand raised to his heart, seems to have been depicted in a more individualized manner than his neighbors and may portray the paintings donor.

As an artist, he thrived on recording the many gestures and poses of its sinewy ballet dancers, whether adored and elegant in a performance, hard at work in rehearsal, or depleted and anonymous backstage. These often-unglamorous images appear in his paintings, pastels, prints, and sculpture, and constitute at least half of his mature work. In Dancer with Bouquets a prima ballerina stands before a painted backdrop and curtsies to her audience. She raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd. At her feet rest bouquets tossed by her admirers. A harsh glare from the footlights illuminates her figure, revealing her rather inelegant profile and giving the painting a sense of frank immediacy. The same stage lighting gives her diaphanous skirt a gauzy, indistinct appearance so favored by the Impressionists.

Edgar Degas was most widely known in his lifetime, and is beloved today particularly, as a painter of the dance. Already in 1867, in his _Mlle Fiocre in the Ballet from La Source_ (Brooklyn Museum), he had begun to interpret subjects drawn from the ballet of the Paris Op√©ra. He continued to do so - in hundreds of paintings, sculptures, pastels and prints - for the next forty years. In the nineteenth century the ballet was one of the prime cultural diversions of the Parisian upper class. Degas fascination may have been fostered at an early age by his father, a wealthy Paris banker who was deeply interested in music and surely held a subscription, or _abonnement_, to the Op√©ra. Degas chose for his subjects not merely the seasoned stars of the Op√©ra stage, like the dancer portrayed in The Chrysler Museum picture, but the lesser ranks of the _corps de ballet_ and even the adolescent apprentices, the _petits rats_. He showed dancers in performance, at rest or in transit backstage, and at work in the rehearsal hall, moving their often reluctant bodies through endless hours of exercise at the barre. In the discipline of the dance Degas may have sensed a metaphor for his own lifelong quest for aesthetic control. More important to the Impressionist Degas, however; was the opportunity the ballet offered to research the transitory effects of gesture and motion, the dynamics of human movement. _Dancer with Bouquets_ was produced late in Degas career - around 1895-1900, when his eyesight was failing and he had begun to work in broader, more vigorous strokes. In the painting a prima ballerina takes a bow at the end of a performance: at her feet are bouquets of flowers tossed by an adoring audience. Standing before a painted landscape backdrop, he raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd before her. The footlights, which fill the scene with a magical, if rather harsh, incandescence, transform the gauzy layers of her gown into a smoldering violet-grey cloud. Though painted on a large, official scale - unusual for the late Degas - _Dancer with Bouquets_ was not exhibited during the artists lifetime, but remained in his studio, where it served as a model for other works. The dancers pose was also used in one of Degas later sculptures, _The Bow_ of c. 1896. The _pentimenti_ visible along the contours of the dancers face and arms indicate that Degas reworked her pose considerably. There are at least four preparatory studies for the figure. One, a half-length _√©tude_ in pastel, was included in the second Degas atelier sale in Paris in December of 1918. The remaining three - full-length figure studies in charcoal and pastel and yet another half-length sketch in charcoal - were dispersed in 1919 at the third of the posthumous Degas sales. In _Dancer with Bouquets_ the scene is viewed obliquely, as if from the wings or a private side box. The odd angle of the viewers vantage point and the tricks it plays with perspective and the dancers pose are typical of Degas later, more abstracted compositions. The sharply lighted, unlovely features of the aging dancers face and the sense of motion arrested create and image of nearly photographic frankness and immediacy - an unstudied snapshot of reality stolen from the flow of time.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.716 Drawn from ancient Greek mythology, the pastoral love story of Daphnis and Chlo√´ was a favorite of 19th-century French academic painters. According to the story, the two were thrown together in infancy and nursed by a sheep and cow. They were soon taken in by a shepherd and his wife and spent a carefree childhood together watching over their stepparents flock. They eventually fell in love with each other and married. Vibert depicts the enchanted moment when childhood gives way to the first stirrings of love, as Daphnis teaches Chlo√´ to play the shepherds flute. The event unfolds in an idyllic forest glade carpeted with grass and flowers, an earthly paradise where all is gentleness and innocence. Vibert exhibited the painting in Paris at the 1866 Salon, and though many praised the work, the twenty-six-year-old artist soon abandoned ambitious mythological subjects like Daphnis and Chlo√´ for small-scale scenes of the Catholic clergy. These light-hearted satires of the religious life proved immensely popular, and with them Vibert became one of the best-known artists of the late 19th century.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

According to Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (2:401-465), Diana, the Roman goddess of the chase and protectress of women, required that the nymphs who attended her on her hunts in Arcadia be chaste. One of them, the beautiful Callisto, had the misfortune to catch Jupiters eye while she was hunting alone in the forest. Disguised as Diana, Jupiter came to her and seduced her. Upon her return to Dianas camp, Callisto reluctantly disrobed to bathe along with the other nymphs and was discovered to be pregnant. Enraged at Callistos transgression, Diana drove her away. This dramatic moment of banishment is the subject David Wilkie depicted in his painting of _Diana and Callisto_. A lofty historical subject drawn from classical mythology, the theme of Diana and Callisto was an unusual one for the Scottish-born Wilkie. Moving to London in 1805, he achieved fame there primarily as a portraitist and painter of earthy, humorous genre images like his well-known _Blind Fiddler_ (Tate Gallery, London). But _Diana and Callisto_ was produced at the beginning of Wilkies career, in 1803-04, when the nineteen-year-old artist was still a student at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and had not yet freed himself from the academic interests of his teacher, John Graham. Under Grahams direction, the Academy held a yearly competition among its students for the best history painting. In 1803 the contest subject was Diana and Castillo; Wilkie submitted the present painting and with it won the first prize of nine pounds in early 1804. Wilkie clearly intended to depict the elevated theme of Diana and Callisto in a suitably serious, idealizing style. Nevertheless, there is much in the painting - for example, the powerful and highly individualized facial expressions of Diana and her nymphs - that forecasts the pithy naturalism of the artists mature genre pictures. Writing about _Diana and Callisto_ in 1848, John Burnet remarked that the close observation of nature [in the painting] was apparent, however inappropriate to the higher walks of art....[Callisto] was made to blush with so deep a colour in the ear and upper part of the neck as gave Graham an opportunity...for descanting on the difficulty of introducing the peculiarities of familiar life into the higher branches of art. Wilkies preliminary compositional study for _Diana and Callisto_ rendered in black and red chalk, is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. Jefferson C.

Dominique Ingres Eugene Delacroix Bronze Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046d-f Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

The vacationers here are not wealthy folk in elegant seaside attire, but ordinary working people enjoying a day off. Like the other French Neo-Impressionists, Henri Edmond Cross was a political leftist who championed the rights of the laboring classes. In paintings like Excursion he created an idealized vision of French society in which labor, the arts, and leisure combined to form a utopian view of modern life. The young Cross arrived in Paris in 1881 and soon befriended the painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, the first practitioners of Neo-Impressionism. Their deliberate dotted painting technique involved the methodical placement of tiny pinpoints of color. In 1892-a year after Seurats death-Cross and Signac settled in Provence, in the South of France. There, inspired by the vibrant light and radiant hues of the Mediterranean coast, Cross produced his most ambitious works in the Neo-Impressionist style, chief among them Excursion.","Provenance":"Cross atelier sale, Hotel Drouot, Oct. 28, 1921 (cat. no. 27); Dr. Roudinesco, Paris; Walter P.

Chrysler, Jr., 77.416 Reference: Isabelle Compin, _H.E. Cross_, Paris, 1964, pp. 135-136, no. 45. Like his colleague Paul Signac (no. 122), Henri Edmond Cross played a key role in the development of Neo-Impressionism following the death of the movements founder, Georges Seurat, in 1891. Born the son of a Douai ironmonger, Cross arrived in Paris by 1881 to conclude his art studies with the painters Emile Dupont-Zipcy and Fran√ßois Bonvin. As an inaugural member of the progressive Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Cross met Seurat and Signac at the founding of that institution in 1884, though he did not fully adopt their dotted painting method - divisionism - for another seven years (see no. 122). By 1892 both Cross and Signac had left Paris and settled in Provence, Cross at Saint-Clair and Signac at nearby Saint-Tropez. Stimulated by the warming radiance and boisterous colors of the Mediterranean coast, they gradually renounced the constraints of Seurats optical theories and densely granulated brush technique. In a series of light-soaked, arcadian landscapes, they evolved a more vibrant divisionist method, painting in progressively broader blocks of brilliant color. Their research was already well advanced by 1895, as seen in Cross imposing _Excursion_ of that year. In time their style would have a profound influence on the art of the young Henri Matisse and his fellow Fauves (nos. 132, 128), who frequently visited Saint-Tropez around 1904 to study with Signac and Cross. One of Cross most complex figurative landscapes, _Excursion_ depicts a carefree group of summer holiday makers as they relax on a windswept bluff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The paintings arcardian mood evokes the eighteenth-century _f√™tes galantes_ of Antoine Watteau. Its decorative surface patterns - its sweeping curves and arabesques - bring to mind the contemporary work of the Nabis. The subdued color scheme of pink, mauve, green and light blue captures perfectly the sun-bleached palette of Provence. Indeed, Cross noted as he worked on the picture that it would require tints compatible with a sunny plain - not too rich, but more neutral and grey in tone. The _Excursion_ was largely finished by December of 1894, when fellow-divisionist Maximilien Luce mentioned it in a letter to Cross: Signac has told me about a painting of yours that he likes very much (the excursionists); from his description it sounds very interesting. While on display in Paris at the 1895 Salon des Ind√©pendants, the work was viewed by Camille Pissarro (no. 96), who referred to it in an April 8 letter to his son Lucien, and by Signac, who recorded his impressions of it in the April 26 entry of his journal. The painting remained with Cross until his death and was sold at the 1921 auction of his atelier. Three preliminary works survive: a pencil sketch for the standing female figure (Cabinet des dessins, Louvre, Paris), a large compositional study in oil (Petit Palais, Mus√©e dArt Moderne, Geneva) and a smaller oil sketch of the landscape (private collection, Paris).

Like his colleague Bouguereau (no. 87), G√©r√¥me was a standard-bearer of the French academic style, a conservative grand master who carried the hallowed traditions of Davidian classicism into the second half of the nineteenth century. Like Bouguereau, too, he was one of the most influential artists of his day. For a full forty years (1863-1904) he served as a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his impeccable professional credentials drew generations of students, many of the Americans, to his atelier. G√©r√¥me achieved his greatest fame as an interpreter of Orientalist subjects (see nos. 76, 88). In the years after 1853 he traveled repeatedly to North Africa and the Near East - he visited Egypt alone seven times - and he devoted more and more of his art to genre images of Arab life. These works offered a more balanced and realistic portrayal of contemporary Egypt and Arabia than had earlier Romantics like Delacroix (no. 76). However, in the clarity and polish of their brushwork - in their careful crafting of detail and draftsmanly precision - G√©r√¥mes Orientalist pictures remained thoroughly academic. G√©r√¥me made his earliest tour of Egypt in 1856. He spent half of his eight-month visit in Cairo and the other half navigating the Nile, sketching the fabled waterway and its exotic river traffic. Thereafter the Nile became a favored setting for his Egyptian genre pieces, as can be seen in the well-known _Excursion of the Harem_ of 1869, in which a delicate private pleasure craft ferries a sultans seraglio along the river. G√©r√¥me exhibited the painting at the Salon of 1869, where it was warmly received. The Empress Eug√©nie, wife of Napoleon III, hoped to buy it but demurred when told its price - 30,000 francs. After viewing the _Excursion_, the critic Th√©ophile Gautier marveled at its atmospheric and luminary subtleties: The boat slips over the clear transparent water, along the misty shore in a sort of luminous fog which produces a magical effect. The bark seems to float at the same time in the water and in the air....the delicate tones of the land of light are rendered by Monsieur G√©r√¥me with absolute fidelity. A recent cleaning of the painting has once again revealed its luminous palette of mauve and violet hues. The work must also have appealed to the young American Thomas Eakins, who studied with G√©r√¥me from 1866 to 1869 and whose Philadelphia sculling pictures of the early 1870s owe an obvious debt to G√©r√¥mes _Excursion_ and other Egyptian river scenes.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2041A and 71.2041B, respectively Antoine Coysevox was a leading sculptor of Louis XIVs reign and a major interpreter of the Sun Kings Baroque court style. After studying at the Acad√©mie Royale, he was named royal _sculpteur_ in 1666. With the assistance of Louis all-powerful first painter, Charles Le Brun, he was made a professor at the Acad√©mie in 1678. Soon after he joined in the sculptural decoration of Versailles. His subsequent career was one of unbroken ascent. Royal commissions and court requests for portrait busts and statues, for funerary moments and ch√¢teau decorations followed one another in rapid succession, and in 1702 Coysevox was named director of the Acad√©mie. Perhaps the most renowned sculptures of Coysevoxs career were the monumental equestrian marble groups of _Fame_ and _Mercury_ that he produced in 1701-02 for the terrace of the Abreuvoir (horses watering pond) at Louis ch√¢teau at Marly. The pendants, which were moved in 1719 to the Tuileries gardens in Paris, were widely acclaimed. The king rewarded Coysevox with an annual pension of 4000 _livres), the largest yearly stipend he ever granted to an artist in his employ. In the years after 1702 Coysevox and his followers were called upon to issue numerous small replicas in bronze, among them the pair in The Chrysler Museum. Soaring aloft on the winged Pegasus, the female figure of Fame blows upon her horn, while her companion Mercury rides heavenward on his own winged mount. The political import of these allegorical pendants is made clear in the imagery decorating their struts. Each bears a breastplate on which Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, entrusts the female personification of France to Louis XIV. The image underscores Louis absolute power as guardian and ruler of France and his divine right as king. As Pegasus leaps skyward with the trumpeting figure of Fame, it is the kings own ascent to greatness and immortality that is celebrated. As emissary of the gods, Mercury carries the same divinely-sanctioned message heavenward. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2060 Like his older colleagues Charles Vernet-Lecomte, Charles Chaplin, and L√©on Perrault, Jacquet was a standard bearer of the conservative academic-classical style in late-19th-century Paris. A pupil of the French academic master William Bouguereau, he perfected a tight, enameled painting technique which he brought to bear on a range of traditional subjects-portraits, historical costume pieces, sensual female nudes, and sentimental genre images like Girl Minstrel. Between 1864 and his death in 1909, he exhibited his work regularly at the Paris Salon, and by the 1890s he was one of the citys most esteemed and widely known painters. Yet with the triumph of modernist painting in the early 20th century, his reputation rapidly declined, and by the 1920s he was all but forgotten. One of the loveliest of Jacquets works, Girl Minstrel coyly captures the melancholy predicament of a young waif who must fend for herself in a harsh world. Dressed in rags and rough homespun, she holds a hurdy-gurdy, a musical instrument long associated in European art with gypsies and the lower classes. As with the paintings by Chaplin and Perrault nearby, Jacquets sentimental subject is little more than a pretext for presenting a suggestive image of an attractive and vulnerable young girl in need of rescue.

Kelekian 53.48.5 From their grand sculpted portals and glowing stained-glass windows to the intricate patterns of their massive stone floors, Gothic cathedrals, cloisters, and other buildings were replete with decorative embellishment. In some instances decoration took the form of figurative scenes drawn from the Bible, illustrating the age-old Christian themes of sin and salvation. In other cases, as with the column capital at left, decoration was more purely ornamental, meant simply to enliven the architecture and give rein to the artists imagination and sense of play. The two male figures crowning the doorway here are too worn to be clearly identified. The figure at right appears to hold a moneybag, perhaps indicating that the door once served as an entrance to a mercantile exchange, or that it illustrated a subject such as the biblical parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Without the sculptural element that initially served as centerpiece-its form sheered away-we are left to speculate about the doors original intent and location. Yet we can still admire the elaborately carved Gothic tracery and foliate frieze, and the solid, well-formed figures, all of which give presence and even grandeur to this modest portal.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2063 The provenance (collection history) of Chaplins Ha√Ød√©e is typical of the fate of many French academic paintings in the 20th century and says much about the vagaries of artistic fashion. Celebrated in his day for his paintings of beautiful women and the female nude, Chaplin completed Ha√Ød√©e in 1873 and unveiled it that same year at the Paris Salon. The painting, which coyly depicts the heroine of Lord Byrons epic poem Don Juan, was purchased from the artist by Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, an important New York collector of French painting who in 1887 bequeathed her entire collection, including Ha√Ød√©e, to the newly-founded Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met retained Ha√Ød√©e through the first half of the 20th century, a time when the critical opinion of 19th-century French academic art had begun to slide. With the triumph of the Abstract Expressionists and other American avant-garde artist groups in the mid-1950s, traditional academic art seemed permanently discredited. And in 1956 the Met decided to remove Ha√Ød√©e and scores of other 19th-century pictures from its collection. Soon after, Chaplins painting was auctioned in New York and purchased by Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. Chrysler shrewdly sensed an opportunity in this long-neglected area of the art market and during the 1950s had begun to acquire major examples of 19th-century French academic painting at historically low prices. (He paid $325 for Ha√Ød√©e.) His instincts proved right. By the mid-1970s, French academic art was once more on the rise, and today it represents one of the most active, and lucrative, segments of the international art market.

In 1733 he moved to Boston, where he established himself as an artisan, working as a glazier and a painter of houses and signs. Around 1740 he began to paint portraits as well. Like many Boston portrait limners of the day, Badger based his simple, forthright style upon the portraiture of John Smibert and Robert Feke and derived many of his compositions from European portrait prints. During the 1750s he was Bostons principal face painter and New Englands best-known artist. After 1760, however, his influence waned rapidly with the emergence of John Singleton Copley and his more sophisticated portrait art (no. 59). During his career Badger painted more than a hundred portraits, many of them likenesses of small children. A mature production of c. 1760, _Jemima Flucker_ possesses that quality of naive charm - the sweetness and fragility - which Badger typically bestowed upon his youngest sitters. The girl is dressed in a blue satin frock trimmed in white and tied loosely at the waist with a pink satin sash. The floral spray in her hair is probably a piece of jewelry, a delicate enamel and silver ornament called a _tremblant_ (a French term that alludes to the fact that the ornament trembled, and shimmered, when the wearer moved). In her right hand she holds a sprig of cherries and on her left, a pet bird. As was often the case when Badger painted children, Jemima Flucker is shown out-of-doors, her full-length form placed directly before the viewer in the foreground of a hilly landscape. The tree that frames the composition at left is almost a Badger signature, a landscape device that occurs throughout his portraiture. A resident of Boston and Cambridge, Jemima Flucker reportedly lived to the age of ninety-five and bequeathed the portrait to her only daughter Elizabeth Child, who was born in 1779. The painting remained in the possession of Jemima Fluckers descendants until 1947. The Chrysler Museum also possesses a letter written by Jemima Flucker to Elizabeth on June 15, 1795. Jefferson C.

The European soldiers and monks have distinctive faces and attire that demonstrate their role and status. The locals, by contrast, are less individualized, mostly shown from behind and in identical postures. This repetition of bodies allowed the artist to build a complex historical scene despite his lack of skill in figure painting.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2054 In this luminous view of his beloved Fontainebleau woods, Rousseau conveys the clarity and dewy calm of a spring morning near the village of Barbizon, when the first rays of the rising sun bathe the ancient oaks of the forest in a golden glow. The site depicted is the Carrefour de la Reine-Blanche-the Crossroads of the White Queen-a glade in the forest not far from Barbizon. Rousseau was a founding member of the Barbizon School and one of the most esteemed landscape painters of his era. He was also a fierce protector of the Fontainebleau woods, leading a crusade against commercial deforestation and petitioning Napoleon III in 1853 to halt the mass planting of pines in the forest.

Th√©odore Rousseau was a founding member of the Barbizon group of artists (nos. 72, 77, 80, 89, 103, 112) and one of the most esteemed landscape painters in mid-nineteenth-century France. In the late 1820s he was already at work at Chailly, near the Fontainebleau Forest. There, and on subsequent visits to the Auvergne (1830) and Normandy (1831), he produced a revolutionary series of vibrant and spontaneous _plein-air_ landscapes, pure landscapes that dispensed with traditional narrative subject matter and classical compositional schemes. Rousseaus subsequent career in Paris was a constant struggle against the conservative forces of the Salon and Acad√©mie Royale. Between 1836 and 1841 his paintings were consistently rejected by Salon juries, a cruel example of official persecution that earned him the sardonic soubriquet, _le grande refus√©_. In 1841 the frustrated Rousseau turned his back on the Salon, where he did not exhibit again until 1849. The years of rejection had their effect on the artist, who took care after 1850 to produce landscapes more in line with official taste. These composed and carefully worked pictures borrowed much from the landscape art of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. _A Clearing in the Forest of Fontainebleau_, one of several canvases that Rousseau undertook at Barbizon in 1860-62 is an impressive example of his mature, more finished and traditional style. Its composition and the handling of foliage recall particularly the works of the Dutch landscapist Meindert Hobbema. the site depicted may be the _Carrefour de la Reine Blanche_ (The Crossroads of the White Queen), a glade in the forest near Barbizon. The site was a favorite of Rousseaus. Three of his other paintings show the same spot; the best known of these is in the Louvre, Paris. The Chrysler Museum picture conveys the clarity and dewy calm of a spring morning near Barbizon, when the first rays of the rising sun bathe the ancient oaks of Fontainebleau in a golden glow.

Such paintings were often collaborative efforts. The central figurative scene was typically executed by a history painter adept at figure composition, while the wreath of flowers was supplied by a still-life specialist. The Museums example was painted in Antwerp in 1651 by one of the most inspired of these Flemish collaborative teams: the history painter Erasmus II Quellinus and the still-life specialist Jan Philips van Thielen, both of whom signed the painting. During their 20-year collaboration, Quellinus and Van Thielen produced a number of garland paintings featuring trompe loeil (illusionistic) stone sculptures set in elaborate sculpted frames, or cartouches, and surrounded by flowers. Acquired in London in 1994, the present painting is among the most ambitious of these and also one of the largest; it measures more than four by three feet and is painted on a single sheet of copper measuring less than a quarter of an inch in thickness. At the center Quellinus depicts grisaille (unpainted) sculptures of the Virgin and Infant Christ subduing the serpent. In its mouth the serpent clutches the apple of original sin. Quellinus sets the figures in an elaborate Baroque cartouche crowned at the upper corners with a pair of pelicans. These ancient symbols of selfless love refer to Christs sacrifice on the cross. Van Thielen weaves the cartouche with ivy, an emblem of eternal life through Christ, and a brilliant halo of blooms - roses, jasmine, snow drops, tulips, nasturtium, apple blossoms and anemones, which symbolize the virtues of the Virgin and Child and pay tribute to their holiness. The flowers are enlivened with moths and butterflies, which allude to Christs resurrection. Before the Museum purchased the painting, the collection contained no still life produced before the mid-18th century. Thus, the painting filled a major gap in the collection and enriches the Museums presentation of 17th-century Catholic art and thought.

Moreland_ _1792_ Gift of Morrie A. Moss, 74.5.2 An artistic prodigy, George Morland was already exhibiting drawings at Londons Royal Academy by the age of ten. The elder Morland - a painter and an art dealer who restored Old Master pictures - was cynically aware of the commercial value of his sons precocious talent, and he pushed him to perfect his craft. While apprenticed to his father in 1777-84, the boy was kept perpetually busy. He made drawings for sale and copied the popular landscapes of Joseph Vernet and the Dutch and Flemish paintings that his father restored in his studio. Once free of his father, Morland rejected the strict discipline of his early years and embraced a life of reckless self-indulgence. Despite his increasingly dissolute ways, he produced a remarkable number of pictures. Many of them were cosigned to unscrupulous art dealers who systematically underpaid him and kept him in debt. He died, alcoholic and debt-ridden, at the age of forty-one. During the later 1780s Morland specialized in moralizing genre paintings of upper-middle class life and in fashionable, sentimental pictures of children at play. After 1790 he turned almost exclusively to picturesque scenes of English country life - interiors of stables and landscapes with gypsies, smugglers and peasants. These subjects were determined partly by the Dutch paintings he had first encountered in his fathers shop and partly by the coastal scenes of Vernet and Philipp de Loutherbourg. Influential, too, were the contemporary landscape styles of Thomas Gainsborough (no. 58) and the French rococo masters. With his landscapes Morland forged a vision of rustic English life that affected native artists for generations. The finest works of Morlands uneven career were his country scenes of the early 1790s. Among them is _A View of Westmorland_ of 1792, which reveals the artist at the height of his powers. Here an apparently innocent genre interlude is made the pretext for a stunning evocation of the English coast. The painting depicts a peasant family proceeding toward the shore where two men await them in a boat. The rather anxious, covert glance of the woman suggests that she and her family are actually involved in the not so innocent act of smuggling contraband, an activity often depicted in Morlands landscapes. Though the figures possess the solidity and the mass of seventeenth-century Dutch masters, the landscape itself, evoked in fluid strokes, is a lush tribute to the rococo. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2080 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 16. Gros originally achieved fame in Paris as one of Napoleons principal painters, glorifying the emperor and his military exploits in a series of vast, heroic canvases. In these works he employed a style inspired less by the Neoclassicism of his revered teacher Jacques-Louis David than by the paintings of Rubens (no. 16), which he had studied during his years in Italy (1793-1800). Gros style, with its passionate emotion and vibrant colors, was hailed by the rising generation of French Romantic painters. The most famous of his Napoleonic history paintings, _The Pesthouse at Jaffa_ (Louvre, Paris), was the highlight of the 1804 Salon; with it, Gros reputation was secured. Despite his success, Gros became increasingly worried that he had abandoned the lofty principles of Davids art for what he called the impertinence and vagabondage of Romantic style, and with Davids death in 1825, he sensed the need to return to an art more strictly aligned to the Neoclassicism of his former mentor. This reversion to an older, and no longer fashionable, manner isolated Gros from many of his earlier supporters, and his art became the object of mounting criticism. The crisis came at the 1835 Salon. There Gros exhibited two works of decidedly classical style and subject matter - _Hercules and Diomedes_ (Mus√©e des Augustins, Toulouse) and _Acis and Galatea_, which the artist had painted in Davids memory two years before. The devastating critical response caused Gros to fall into a deep depression, and, soon thereafter, he drowned himself in the Seine. Today Gros is rightly recognized as the crucial link between the austere and learned classicism of his teacher David and the more colorful Romanticism of...Delacroix (Francis Broun). Gros took the mythological subject of _Acis and Galatea_ from a passage in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (13:738-897). In it the nymph Galatea is courted by the hideous Cyclops, Polyphemus, whose love she spurns for that of the shepherd Acis. To proclaim his love, the Cyclops makes music upon his pipes, while Acis and Galatea hide nearby listening. The giant soon spies the pair and, raging with jealousy, crushes Acis beneath a boulder. In Gros painting the terror-stricken lovers, concealed in a cave at waters edge, cower at the approach of Polyphemus, who stalks the countryside blowing his horn. Gros critics balked at the paintings melodramatic tone. They complained, too, that its figures lacked grace, but conceded that they were effectively drawn. In truth, both figures were modeled upon antique sculptural prototypes: Galateas pose recalls that of the so-called Crouching Aphrodite, while Acis suggests the stance of a combative Hercules. The painting and two preliminary drawings (locations unknown) were dispersed during the posthumous sale of Gros studio in November of 1835. In 1863 the picture was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Del√®stre, a former student of Gros who authored the first biography of the artist. Jefferson C.

The Neapolitan school of painting began its rise to international prominence somewhat belatedly, in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Previously Naples had been a provincial art center, its painters influenced and overshadowed by the traditionally more progressive schools of Florence and Rome. As did many of his sixteenth-century colleagues, the Neapolitan Criscuolo no doubt visited Rome. There, his art was transformed by Raphaels High Renaissance paintings and by the Mannerist works of Raphael followers like Perino del Vaga. Returning to Naples, he devised a version of Roman Mannerism that made him one of the mores sophisticated painters in that still parochial center. As his career progressed, Criscuolo - and the Neapolitan school with him - embraced more fully the tenets of the Roman and Florentine high _maniera_ (later Mannerist style), prompted no doubt by visits from itinerant painters like Giorgio Vasari in 1544. A work of Crisculos early post-Roman maturity, the undated _Adoration of the Magi_ has been placed by scholars in the mid-1540s on the strength of its strong stylistic resemblance to the artists 1545 _Adoration with the Trinity_ in the Museo e Gallerie Nazionali di Capodimonte, Naples. In the _Adoration of the Magi_, Criscuolo reshapes the art of Perino del Vaga in more current _maniera_ style, creating an elegant image of self conscious grace, of characteristically compressive _maniera_ forms and surface suavity. The artists essentially two dimensional design is particularly pronounced in the forms of the three kings, which have been flattened against the picture plane in a dense pattern of sinuous line and shifting color and texture. As they present their gifts to the Child, the three kings - the young Moor Balthasar, the middle-aged Melchior and the grey bearded Caspar - proclaim the allegiance of all earthly rulers to the divine King of Kinds. Symbolizing this act of fealty is the crown that the eldest magus has pulled from his head and placed on the steps beneath Christs feet. Its piers crumbling and overgrown with vines, the architectural ruin behind the Holy Family serves as a venerable Christian symbol for the old Jewish law, which was destroyed by the coming of Christ. Though based ultimately on High Renaissance canons, the faces and forms of Virgin and child have been keyed to a sharper _maniera_ pitch and, thus, exhibit a more rarified and eccentric kind of beauty. Remarkable, too, are Criscuolos palette of acidic blues, greens and yellows and the snarling griffin carved from the leg of Christs throne. Criscuolos paintings are rare in American collections, and the _Adoration of the Magi_ offers a unique and exceptionally fine example of provincial Italian response to Roman high style in the mid-sixteenth century.

Together with Veronese and the aging Titian, Tintoretto was a presiding master of the Venetian school of painting in the second half of the sixteenth century. The sign over his studio door read the color of Titian, the drawing of Michelangelo. His bold combination of northern and central Italian techniques yielded a passionate and lyrical late Mannerist style that brought him countless private and public commissions in Venice. Despite surface abrasion and darkened pigments, Tintorettos inimitable painterly technique can be seen in his treatment of Floras left ankle formed by trails of phosphorescent white, and in the fluid, glazed golds of her luminous hair.","Provenance":"Painted ca. 1555 for the Palazzo Barbo, San Pantaleone, Venice (original location); Private collection, Southern France, 1957; Newhouse Galleries, 1958; Walter P.

Together with Veronese (no. 13) and the aging Titian, Tintoretto presided over the Venetian school of painting during the second half of the sixteenth century. His style was formed by Michelangelo, the Venetian Mannerists and Titian, to whom he may have been apprenticed. From them he forged an art of violent energy and monumental sweep, a passionate late Mannerist style marked by an astonishing technical freedom. Tintoretto and his many assistants worked almost continuously on large-scale commissions for Venetian churches, palaces, charitable confraternities and government buildings, covering acres of wall and ceiling with a feverish velocity that dumbfounded his rivals. As had the classical writers and artists who influenced them so profoundly, sixteenth-century European painters frequently used the cycle of the seasons as a metaphor for the eternal passage of time. Their paintings of the seasons were often produced in sets of four, with each picture featuring a male or female figure who personified the particular season with the help of appropriate seasonal attributes. Following traditional practice, Tintoretto produced his _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ around 1555 as part of a series of four paintings of the seasons. Here, a lively and robust Flora, goddess of flowers and spring, shakes off the torpor of winter. The spray of flowers that seems to issue from her womb shows that she is fertile with the promise of new life. She is a splendid, full-bodied symbol of the generative power of the reawakening earth. Tintorettos companion pictures of _Summer_ and _Winter_ survive: the former is found in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the latter in a private collection in Bergamo. The concluding painting of _Autumn_ has yet to be recovered. The Chrysler Museum and National Gallery paintings were originally fitted with octagonal frames that covered their corners. The seventeenth-century biographer of Venetian artists, Carlo Ridolfi, noted in his _Le Maraviglie dellArte_ (1648) that Tintoretto produced a set of Seasons pictures as part of his decoration of a room in the Barbo Palace in Venice: In the Palazzo Barbo at San Pantaleone one sees in the panelling of one room a Capriccio of Dreams with some gods in heaven and various symbols of things that come into the minds of men while they are dreaming; in the surrounding area the Four Seasons are personified. Scholars have suggested that the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace was a ceiling painting and that it can be identified with a large, octagonal canvas by Tintoretto in the Detroit Institute of the Arts, the so-called _Dreams of Man_. It has also been proposed that the _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ and its three companion paintings are the Four Seasons that originally flanked the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace, composing, perhaps, a frieze of paintings along the tops of the walls.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.609 The subject of Puvis de Chavanness Allegory has long puzzled scholars. Some believe that these three men in Italian medieval and Renaissance dress-an architect, a monk, and a poet-are meant to portray specific, famous Italians-possibly the painter and architect Giotto, the Florentine firebrand Savonarola, and the creator of the Divine Comedy, Dante. Others have suggested that the figures should be viewed more broadly as allegorical embodiments of artistic, religious, and poetic inspiration-as personifications of the different aspects of Renaissance genius engaged in a colloquy on the nature of art and the spirit. Puvis painted this tribute to Italian greatness at the age of twenty-four, while visiting Rome in 1848. It was the young artists first major painting, and it clearly reflects his early interest in the robust, romantic art of Thomas Couture and Ary Scheffer. Puvis went on to achieve great fame in France for his large-scale mural paintings. Using an altogether different style marked by a flat, decorative approach to the human figure, he created in these works a pale and silent realm of motionless, columnar forms-a remote world of dreams that enchanted the Symbolists of the 1880s and 1890s. Yet even in early works like Allegory, we can trace the basic features of those mature works-their sense of mystery, gentle poetry, and contemplative calm.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"Signed and inscribed: Rome, 1848.","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr., 71.545 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 41. The marine and landscape specialist Jongkind was, perhaps, the most important precursor of the French Impressionist school. He served as mentor to Eug√®ne Boudin (no. 109) and to the young Claude Monet, whom he encountered in Normandy in the summer of 1862 and impressed greatly with his sparkling _plein-air_ pen sketches and watercolors. From that time on, Monet wrote, he was my real master, and it was to him that I owed the final education of my eye. Born and trained initially in Holland, Jongkind arrived in Paris in 1846 and joined the atelier of the famous marine painter Eug√®ne Isabey. Within a year he was painting along the Normandy and Brittany coasts. He made his debut at the 1848 Salon, and though his works sold well, he was plagued by debts and was often deeply depressed. At his mothers death in 1855, Jongkind suffered a nervous collapse and withdrew to Holland, where he lived for five years as an impoverished semi-recluse. After his return to Paris in 1860, however, his fortunes brightened, largely through the efforts of his enthusiastic patron Th√©ophile Bascle and his new-found companion Josephine Fesser-Borrh√©e. By the mid-1860s Jongkind had reached his creative pinnacle, producing some of the most vibrant and spontaneous of his Pre-Impressionist landscapes. Among these mature works is the 1866 _Along the Ourcq_, which was apparently purchased from the artist by Bascle. The painting depicts the Ourcq canal, which lies just northeast of Paris. Since Mme Fesser-Borrh√©es brother-in-law lived near the canal, in the village of Pantin, Jongkind had ample opportunity to study and paint the waterway and its well-trodden towpaths. The Ourcq was, in fact, one of Jongkinds preferred sites in the mid-1860s, when he sketched and painted it repeatedly under varying atmospheric conditions - in sunlight, in moonlight, in the rain. An 1864 painting of the canal by Jongkind, today in the collection of Paul Mellon (Upperville, Virginia), and a watercolor view from the same year (private collection, Paris) directly anticipate the design of The Chrysler Museum canvas. Jongkind customarily composed his paintings in the studio, consulting sketches he had made _sur le motif_ (on the spot). Thought not painted out-of-doors, _Along the Ourcq_ nonetheless conveys the freshness and freedom of a rapidly executed _plein-air_ impression. These were the very qualities that attracted Monet and, as Boudin said, opened the door through which all the Impressionists passed. Jefferson C.

Others, like the Parisian sculptor Prosper dEpinay, held firm to the traditional tenets of academic classicism. The smooth, idealized forms, meticulously finished surface, and open sentimentality of DEpinays impressive marble group, Amor Forgiven, are typical of the kind of conservative, academic sculpture that dominated the Paris Salon in the final decades of the 19th century. Though this kind of sculpture fell out of fashion with the rise of modernist art in the early 20th century, it has recently returned to favor and is now avidly sought by collectors. Classical mythology is filled with stories about the love goddess Venus and her mischievous winged offspring Cupid, who often disobeyed his mother and aimed his arrows of love at the wrong targets. In DEpinays sculpture, Venus gathers her son in her arms, presumably forgiving him for one of his transgressions. DEpinays lighthearted mythological subject is largely a pretext for a fetching portrayal of a sensual female nude and cherubic child in playful embrace. The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923). By the mid-20th century it was owned by the family of Lydia Aspergren of Norfolk, who donated it to the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences in 1963. Kept largely in storage since then, the sculpture was recently cleaned for exhibit in Behind the Seen. Conservation Project After sitting in storage for decades, DEpinays Amor Forgiven was in need of a thorough surface cleaning. In August of 2005, sculpture conservator Andrew Baxter was contracted to clean the sculpture in time for its exhibition in Behind the Seen. Mr. Baxter began the process by dry cleaning the surface with a vacuum and erasures, removing as much grime as possible before moving on to soap and water. Using swabs and brushes, he next wet-cleaned the surface with a non-ionic soap. To draw out deeply embedded stains, he applied clay poultices to the surface. Once the cleaning process was complete, Mr. Baxter covered the surface with a protective coating of wax.","Provenance":"The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923).

Though celebrated today as one of the earliest and most creative of the Impressionists, the landscapist Sisley enjoyed no such recognition during his lifetime. From the early 1870s, when he began to paint professionally, until his death in 1899, he practiced his art in poverty and obscurity, struggling in vain against a hostile public and indifferent press. A Parisian by birth, Sisley entered the atelier of Charles Gleyre (no. 100) in 1862 and there befriended fellow students Claude Monet, Fr√©d√©ric Bazille and Renoir (no. 113). Within months the four young artists had departed from Gleyres studio for Chailly-en-Bi√®re and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There, through their communal experiments with _plein-air_ painting, they sowed the first seeds of Impressionism, and by 1870 Sisleys landscapes had begun to exhibit the clear, high-keyed tones and sketchy, broken color touches of the new style. Though his later landscapes displayed the formal disintegrations inherent in the Impressionist technique, Sisley remained committed to an art of compositional and spatial clarity, to architectonically structured landscapes and carefully calibrated perspectives. Sisley spent most of his life working in the villages and countryside around Paris. Initially he lived in or near Louveciennes (1871-74), Marly-le-Roi (1875-77) and S√®vres (1877-79) and showed a special interest in river and snow scenes. In later years (1880-99) he resided near Fontainebleau in the hamlets of Veneux-Nadon and neighboring Moret, at the juncture of the Seine and Loing rivers, where he repeatedly painted the banks of these waterways and the adjacent fields. Produced at the onset of his final Moret period, _Apple Trees in Flower_ of 1880 portrays the crisp, breezy weather of early spring, when the chill of winter still lingers on the land. Its forms merely summarized by Sisleys dappling, Impressionist brush, the landscape is brought into structural focus through the anchoring verticals of the blossoming fruit trees. The receding lines of the trees also create a sense of deep space, a characteristic feature of Sisleys art. Sisley relished the challenge of capturing the transitory effects of light and weather and the fleeting magic of seasonal change. In an enthusiastic letter written from Moret in the spring of 1883, he reported: The weather has been wonderful. I have started work again, but unfortunately, because it has been such a dry spring, the fruit trees are not flowering all at once, and the blossoms are dropping very quickly. And I am trying to paint them! Jefferson C. Harrison. _The Chrysler Museum Handbook of the European and American Collections: Selected Paintings, Sculpture and Drawings_.

Fromentin possessed remarkably varied artistic talents. He achieved fame not only as a painter, but as a travel writer, novelist, and art critic. After devoting his youth to the study of law, he resolved to become an artist and in 1844 began his training in Paris with the landscape painter Louis Cabat. A fleeting visit to Algeria in 1846 confirmed his growing interest in romantic, Orientalist themes (see nos. 76, 99). When two of his North African pictures were applauded at the 1847 Salon in Paris - his public debut - he returned to Algeria for a longer stay. By 1850 Fromentin was well-known in France as a leading Orientalist painter, and his final Algerian sojourn of 1852-53 provided enough material to sustain him in this genre for the rest of his life. Fromentins passionate interest in North Africa inspired him to write two travel accounts, _A Summer in the Sahara_ and _A Year in the Sahel_, in the later 1850s. In 1862 his famous novel _Dominique_ appeared in print, and just before his untimely death at age fifty-five, he issued his treatise on Dutch and Flemish painting, _Les Ma√Ætres dautrefois_, which is viewed today as one of the most significant pieces of art criticism produced in the nineteenth century. Displayed at the 1863 Salon, The Chrysler Museum painting captures one of Fromentins favorite and most picturesque subjects - the nomadic Arab plainsman astride his coursing steed. Here a falconer on the hunt races before his comrades, clutching in his upraised hand a perch and the leather leashes holding his birds of prey. Fromentins Salon offerings elicited almost unanimously positive reactions from conservative critics and the public, and the _Arab Falconers_ was especially well received. The critic Paul Mantz, for example, marveled at the spirited conception of the horseman, who seemed bewitched by the seductions of the chase. The figure...is full of movement and wild energy. Others praised the artists fluid handling of the brush, which bathes the paintings surface in veils of liquid color. Many European artists of the day viewed the Arab plainsman as an uncorrupted child of Nature, a heroic Noble Savage whose life was still intimately tied to the rhythms and pulse of nature. Fromentin endorses this romanticized view in the _Arab Falconer_, in which the hunter seems as fierce and wild as his mount and birds of prey. The great popularity of the painting encouraged Fromentin to repeat its composition, in mirror image, one year later in a picture now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A closely related watercolor, possibly a study for the _Arab Falconer_, is in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Jefferson C.

In the decades following Napoleons Egyptian campaign of 1798-99, the mysteries of the Islamic East were gradually revealed to a fascinated public in France. Questing for novel and exotic experiences, many Romantic artists began to journey to Morocco, Egypt and the Holy Land. There they discovered new subjects for genre paintings in the Oriental cultures of North Africa and the Near East (see also nos. 88, 99).

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.517 Millet was the leader of the Barbizon School, the group of French landscape and genre painters who abandoned Paris around 1850 to work in the village of Barbizon and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There Millet and his Barbizon colleagues produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes -among them, Babys Slumber- that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants. The simplicity and directness of these pictures helped shape the new Realist style that surfaced in French art in the mid-nineteenth century. Babys Slumber depicts the interior of a peasant cottage bathed in soft summer light. In it a young woman busies herself with domestic chores -sewing and mending- while with her foot she rocks her sleeping child in its cradle. Visible through the open window, a man -presumably her husband- works in the garden beyond. Millets vision of maternal devotion and domestic harmony in the countryside serves as a tribute to the timeless virtues of the French peasantry -patience, diligence, perseverance- and to the dignity and continuity of life on the land.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1855-1861; probably Alfred Sensier, Paris, 1861; S.F.

Within a decade he had become a leader of the small, but influential group of landscape and genre painters that had assembled in that tiny village near the Fontainebleu Forest (nos. 72, 77, 86, 103, 112). There, inspired by seventeenth-century Dutch painting and warm recollections of his peasant upbringing in Normandy, Millet produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes - among them _Babys Slumber_ of c. 1855 - that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants (see also nos. 81, 89). The humble naturalism of these pictures - their naive directness of vision (Robert Herbert) - helped shape the new Realist aesthetic that surfaced in French painting in the mid-nineteenth century. While at Barbizon, Millet instructed a number of younger American painters, who helped to popularize his work in the United States, particularly in Boston. Among them was the Boston artist Edward Wheelwright, who came to Barbizon to study with Millet in October, 1855. Wheelwright stayed on until the following spring and published his recollections in 1876 in the _Atlantic Monthly_; one of the noteworthy events he recounted was his viewing of _Babys Slumber_. Not long after Millet had finished the picture, Wheelwright and several other painters visited his studio while he was away in Paris on business. Inspecting his canvases one by one, they happened upon the painting: At last was brought out from its hiding place a picture representing the interior of a peasants cottage. A young mother was seated, knitting or sewing, while with one foot she rocked the cradle in which lay a child asleep....Anything more exquisitely beautiful than this sleeping child has rarely, I believe, been painted. Through the open window the eye looked out into a garden where a man with his back turned appeared to be at work. The whole scene gave the impression of a hot summers day; you could almost see the trembling motion of the heated air outside, you could almost smell the languid scent of flowers, you could almost hear the droning of the bees, and you could positively feel the absolute quiet and repose, the solemn silence, that pervaded the picture. All those at least felt it who saw the picture upon that...morning. A sudden hush fell upon all the noisy and merry party....The silence that was in some way painted into the canvas seemed to distill from it into the surrounding air. To give depth and resonance to his genre images, Millet frequently alluded to biblical or classical themes. _Babys Slumber_ suggests the domestic harmony of the Holy Family, a parallel that lends an air to sacredness to this modest peasant scene.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.650 Reference: Yale, 1987-88, no. 11. The iridescent color schemes and illusionistic designs of late Baroque decoration were first championed in Naples by Luca Giordano. He was the unrivaled leader of the Neapolitan school of painting during the second half of the seventeenth century and one of the most influential of contemporary European artists. His extraordinary speed and productivity as a painter were legendary. Colleagues called him the Thunderbolt and _Luca fa presto_. Equally dazzling was his capacity to imitate the works of other artists. His boundless talent for creative mimicry was first honed by his father Antonio, a Neapolitan painter and copyist, and in time it earned him the nickname Proteus. For Giordano, the decades after 1650 were marked by almost constant travel - to Florence, Venice, Rome and eventually to Spain. Already by 1660 he had abandoned the dark, Caravaggesque style of Jusepe de Ribera, quite possibly one of his teachers, for a lighter, more colorful late Baroque manner derived from Pietro da Cortonas Roman works and those of the great sixteenth-century Venetians. The Chrysler Museum painting is one of at least three pictures by Giordano (Museo del Castelvecchio, Verona; Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden) that illustrate the mythology of Bacchus and Ariadne. A fluent work of full maturity, it has been dated to Giordanos Florentine sojourn of 1685-86. The dating is based on its strong stylistic kinship to the artists contemporary frescos in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, and particularly to the Medici-Riccardi _Triumph of Bacchus_. As recounted in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (8:170-182) and other classical sources, Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, helped her beloved Theseus escape the Labyrinth and then sailed with him to the island of Naxos, where he deserted her. Heartbroken at her abandonment, she was discovered on the shore by Bacchus, god of wine, who fell in love with her and, after his voyage to India, returned to marry her. He then placed her marriage crown in the heavens, where it was transformed into a constellation, the corona borealis. In Giordanos painting a love-smitten Bacchus and his celebrants -- maenads, satyrs, putti -- encounter Ariadne for the first time, stealing up on her as she slumbers sadly at waters edge. Ariadnes future betrothal is forecast in the crown of stars that hovers above her. The paintings stately tone and cool palette of silvery pinks and blues evoke Poussin and Titian, while the striding figure of Bacchus pays homage specifically to Titians _Bacchus and Ariadne_ in the National Gallery, London. In Ariadnes pose the inspired mimic Giordano presents a witty reprise of Michelangelos sculpture of _Night_from the Tomb of Guiliano deMedici (San Lorenzo, Florence). Jefferson C.

In the art academies of eighteenth-century Europe, painters of historical and religious themes (see nos. 47, 52) were valued far more highly than those who devoted themselves to the minor subjects of genre, landscape, and still life. Yet, the most inspired interpreters of the minor subjects could achieve considerable fame in their lifetimes and genuine immortality in the annals of art history. One such genius was Chardin, who was among the most revered painters of still life and genre in mid-eighteenth-century Paris. Championed particularly by the influential philosopher and art critic Denis Diderot (d. 1784), Chardin enjoyed both official and popular success. He was an honored member of the Acad√©mie Royale and a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon, and his paintings were avidly collected by a newly affluent French middle class. In his later still lifes, Chardin abandoned his earlier interest in the meticulous delineation of texture and detail and concentrated on more profound visual elements. Color and volume, half-light and highlight, the broad compositional interplay of solid and void - these became the underlying concerns of his mature still lifes such as the _Basket of Plums_. When the painting - or its replica, which is located today in a private French collection - was shown by Chardin at the 1765 Salon, Diderot described it briefly in his commentaries on the exhibition: ...placed on a stone bench, a wicker basket full of plus, for which a paltry string serves as a handle, and scattered around it some walnuts, two or three cherries and a few small bunches of grapes [in truth, white currants]. Though the arrangement is typically spare, the effect on the eye is magical. The luscious mound of purple and rosy red plums smolders in the shadowy light. The currants gleam like pearls. What emerges from this humble assembly of fruits and nuts, and from the velvety brushwork that informs it, is a vision of the poetic essence of objects that dazzled Chardins contemporaries and captivates us perhaps even more today.

In 1907, the year following C√©zannes death, the portion of the mural containing the nude was detached from the plaster wall, transferred to canvas, and sold. The painting represents C√©zannes first important essay on the bathing nude, an image that would occupy him for the rest of his career.","Provenance":"The artist, Jan de Bouffan (near Aix-en-Provence), ca. 1864/68-1899; Louis Granel, Jas de Bouffan, 1899-1907; Josse Hessel, Paris, 1907; Georges Bernheim, Paris; Alphonse Kahn, Saint-Germain-en-Laye; Paul Rosenberg and Co., New York, by 1952; Walter P.

A major influence on early twentieth-century modernism, C√©zanne labored to restore structure and intellectual control to painting following the era of Impressionism. I want to make of Impressionism something solid, he once proclaimed, like the art of the Museums. In his mature paintings of the 1880s and 1890s, and particularly in his later landscapes and still lifes, C√©zanne portrayed the visible world as an architectonic interlocking of colors and simple, reductive forms, a tight and permanent semiabstraction that would in time inspire the Cubism of Picasso and Braque (no. 139). C√©zannes mature, Post-Impressionist style began to emerge after 1872, when his encounters with Camille Pissarro (no. 96) rapidly transformed his art. Before that time, the young painter had worked in an altogether different style, a blunt and brooding Romantic mode full of dark energy and often violent emotion. This early style, which scholars have only recently begun to research in depth, is revealed to spectacular effect in _Bather and Rocks_ of c. 1860-66. C√©zanne initially divided his time between his native Provence and Paris, where his paintings were consistently refused by the Salon and ridiculed by the critics at the Impressionist exhibits of 1874, 1876 and 1877. After 1877 he secluded himself more and more in Provence - at LEstaque and in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence - and there lived the life of a misanthropic recluse. He often worked in these years at the Jas de Bouffan, his familys country estate on the outskirts of Aix. C√©zannes father, a hard-nosed banker who had little patience for his sons artistic aspirations, purchased the seventeenth-century mansion of the Jas de Bouffan in 1859. Soon after, he reluctantly agreed to let C√©zanne have a studio there. During the following decade he also allowed his son to decorate the grand salon of the Jas de Bouffan with murals of his own design. These large-scale paintings, which C√©zanne executed in oil directly on the plaster walls of the room, are among the most ambitious of his early works. They included two large landscape murals, painted in 1860-62. Probably after his visit to Paris in 1862-64, C√©zanne added the figure of a massively-muscled male nude seen from behind to one of these landscapes - a rocky vista with pine trees and a rushing stream. This _Landscape with Bather_ remained _in situ_ and intact until 1907, the year after C√©zannes death. At that time Louis Granel, who had purchased the house from the artist in 1899, had most of the murals detached from the walls, transferred to canvas and readied for sale. The only portion of the _Landscape with Bather_ that was removed from the wall (and saved from destruction) was the nude male figure - i.e., the _Bather and Rocks_ that is today in The Chrysler Museum. The design and dorsal presentation of C√©zannes nude were clearly influenced by Gustave Courbet, as can be seen, for example, from Courbets 1853 painting of _The Bathers_ in the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier. However, the style of C√©zannes figure - its turbulent brush technique and heavy, black contours - more closely recalls the passionate Romantic art of Delacroix (no. 76). Jefferson C.

Born in Honfleur, the landscape and marine painter Boudin was the son of a Norman ships captain. In his mature pictures he repeatedly portrayed the grand sweep of sea and sky along the French Atlantic coast. Though his first years as a painter were not easy, Boudin remained true to his brisk _plein-air_ technique, and in 1858, at Rouelles in Normandy, he began to teach the young Claude Monet how to paint out-of-doors. The budding Impressionist was soon entranced by the directness of Boudins approach and by his ability to capture the ever-changing qualities of natures light and atmosphere. If I have become a painter, Monet later said, I owe it to Eug√®ne Boudin. Boudins role as mentor to Monet - a role later assumed by Johan Jongkind (no. 95) - confirmed his position as one of Frances most important Pre-Impressionist painters. Boudin received his first recognition in the mid-1860s with his now-famous Trouville and Deauville beach scenes. Executed _en plein air_ with a revolutionary fluidity and dash, these small paintings of fashionable Second-Empire vacationers at seaside were applauded at the Salon in Paris and laid the groundwork for his subsequent success. In later productions like _Beached Boats at Berck_ - an unusually large landscape for Boudin - the artist somewhat tempered his early style with a more deliberate, descriptive realism. The site depicted in the painting is the shore at Berck-sur-Mer, a small village along the English Channel between Dieppe and Calais. Boudin had already visited Berck in 1874, five years before he produced the picture. In the painting, Norman fishermen rest in the humid haze of a summer afternoon, their boats temporarily beached by the receding tide. Some of the fishermen repair their craft, while others take their midday meal. The vast canopy of cloud-filled sky is masterfully portrayed, confirming Corots salute to Boudin as the king of skies. The Impressionists were fascinated by Boudins ability to evoke specific kinds of weather and times of day. So, too, were the critics. One can guess the very season, the time of day, and the wind in Boudins work, marveled Charles Baudelaire in his account of the 1859 Salon. Jefferson C.

Independent and strong-willed, Bonheur ignored the limitations placed on academic training for women and instead taught herself art. She made life studies of farm animals-horses, bull, cows-and copied earlier animal paintings found in the Louvre. She studied animal anatomy in the citys slaughter-houses and even dissected animals at the National Veterinary Institute. Her efforts bore fruit in 1855, when her monumental Horse Fair (see illustration) brought her international acclaim. Like Harriet Hosmer in Rome, Bonheur cut an eccentric figure in Paris, favoring female companions, mens clothes, and cigarettes. When challenged on her unconventional wardrobe, she merely claimed it simplified her field work with animals: I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my sex was a constant bother. This is why I solicited the authorization to wear mens clothing from the prefect of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire, and nothing else. The epithets of imbeciles have never bothered me.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

The young son of Dalous London assistant, Angelino Cartioni served as his model. Though Dalou worked to build his reputation in Paris, his career first blossomed in London, where he fled for a time to escape the political reprisals that befell other radical supporters of the Paris Commune at the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871). He eventually became one of the most productive and successful sculptors working in France.

The Bust of the Savior was his last work, carved by his own hand at the age of eighty in spiritual preparation for his imminent death. He willed it to his friend and patron, Christina, Queen of Sweden, Romes preeminent Catholic convert. Bernini created a majestic Christ, his head turned heavenward to intercede between God and humankind: the Salvador Mundi (Savior of the World) raises his right hand in eternal blessing. The gesture also alludes to Christs metamorphosis from mortal to divine being. After Christs resurrection and before his ascension into heaven he took care that his body remain undefiled. Noli Me Tangere, he commanded, with his right hand raised. Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). Bernini designed an elaborate seven-foot-high pedestal to support the sculptures base. Viewed from below and at a distance, Christs elongated and exaggerated features would have appeared slightly foreshortened and softened. Sculpted kneeling angels were to support the marble Christ. Roman Catholics would have associated this elevated image of the Savior with the priests Elevation of the Host during Mass (the celebration of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion).","Provenance":"The artist, 1679-1680; Queen Christina of Sweden, Rome, 1680-1689; Pope Innocent XI, Odescalchi, 1689; The Palazzo Odescalchi, 1713; Vicomte Jacques de Canson, Paris, 1952; Walter P.

Bernini was the greatest sculptor and architect of the seventeenth century and the major founder of Italian High Baroque style. An artistic demigod who dominated the Roman art world for more than fifty years, he was courted by kings and popes throughout his career. At the time of his death - he succumbed to a stroke in Rome in 1680 - he was revered throughout Europe. Bernini began the marble _Bust of the Savior_ in 1679, only a year before his death. Both of his early biographers, Filippo Baldinucci (1682) and Berninis son Domenico (1713), discuss the work at length. They record that the artist intended to present the bust - his final work - as a gift to his dear friend and ardent supporter, Queen Christina of Sweden, who was then living in Rome. Baldinucci writes: Bernini was already in the eightieth year of his life. For some time past he had been turning his most intense thoughts to attaining eternal repose rather than to increasing his earthly glory. Also, deep within his heart was the desire to offer, before closing his eyes to this life, some sign of gratitude to Her Majesty the Queen of Sweden, his most special patron. In order, therefore, to penetrate more deeply into the first concept and to prepare himself better for the second, he set to work with the greatest intensity to create in marble a half -length figure, larger than life-size, of Our Savior Jesus Christ. This is the work that he said was his favorite and it was the last given to the world by his hand. According to Baldinucci, Christina refused the gift in a moment of royal self-deprecation: The Queens opinion of, and esteem for, the statue was so great that, not finding herself in circumstances in which it was possible to give a comparable gift in exchange, she chose to reject it rather than fail in the slightest degree to equal the royal magnificence of her intention. Bernini then bequeathed the bust to her, and, at Christinas death in 1689, it passed to Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi, in whose family it remained at least until 1713, when it was mentioned in an inventory of the Palazzo Odescalchi. By then the sculpture had achieved considerable fame, having been chosen as the official emblem of the Apostolic Hospital in Rome. An early description of the bust states that it originally stood atop an elaborate and richly ornamented pedestal that rose more than seven feet from the floor. Constructed from Berninis own design, the pedestal was composed of a gilded wooden socle, stepped at the top, that supported a pair of kneeling angels, also in gilded wood. The angels, in turn, upheld the bust on a base of Sicilian jasper. As Irving Lavin noted in 1972, Berninis _Savior_ is the first monumental marble bust since antiquity that... [was designed to]...stand free on a pedestal and include both arms. [The figures left hand is tucked beneath the right, its wrist just visible.] It combines, in an unprecedented way for a Christian image, the living and dramatic quality of a narrative figure with the commemorative and idolous quality of a classical bust monument. Turning his head heavenward and raising his right hand in blessing, Berninis Christ proclaims his role as intercessor between God and man, his divine mission as _Salvator Mundi_. Though universal in its spiritual message, the bust remains an intensely personal creation, Berninis very private tribute to the deity on the eye of his own demise. It is Berninis last will and testament as an artist, an embodiment of his faith and hope for salvation. Among the artists preliminary drawings for the _Bust of the Savior_ are a black chalk study of the angels that once supported the bust (Museum der bildenden K√ºnste, Leipzig) and a sheet of black chalk studies of the Saviors head and chest (Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, Rome). A marble copy of the bust, made by an unknown artist at the time of Berninis death, is preserved in the Cathedral at S√©es in France." },

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

At the Elders death in 1553, Cranach the Younger inherited his busy workshop and carried his fathers style into the late sixteenth century. With its broadly modeled figures and bright colors flatly applied, the schematic design of the painting here typifies the Cranach shop style-a style intended to convey narrative as simply and directly as possible. As told in John 8:2-11, the Pharisees, hoping to trap Jesus in an intellectual double bind, confronted him with an adulterous woman and demanded she be killed for her crime as dictated by the law of Moses. Jesus deflected their challenge by answering, Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone. (That text, in German, is inscribed along the paintings upper edge.) Filled with shame, the defeated Pharisees dispersed. Cranach depicts the storys climax: As the Pharisees clamor for an answer, Christ points compassionately at the adulteress and forgives her sin. Luther himself preached on the theme of Christ and the adulteress, reminding his listeners that any sinner, if repentant, could be forgiven in the kingdom of Christ.","Provenance":"Wesendonck auction, Cologne (Lempertz), Nov. 27, 1935, lot 24, on loan to Bonn, Provinzialmuseum (cat. 1927, nr. 50); Wesendonck collection, Hamburg, Germany; Gsell collection, Vienna, Austria; Schonemon Galleries, NYC; Walter P.

Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at far left, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman. While in contrast, the more finely worked and opulent House of Simon reveals the delicacy of the emerging rococo.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric. The pendants remained with the artist until his death and were sold from his estate in Paris in 1764. Jefferson C.

Christ, on the left, wears red and blue. The woman facing him in the center foreground wears blue; her long hair is down and loose.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.639 Each of De Troys companion paintings illustrates a biblical scene in which Christ blesses an outcast woman and, in so doing, demonstrates his compassion for the downtrodden, yet faithful victim. Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at right, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman. While in contrast, the more finely worked and opulent House of Simon reveals the delicacy of the emerging rococo. Here the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabrics.","Provenance":"The artist, 1743-1752; the artists estate sale, Paris, April 9, 1764; Frances Lady Ashburton; sale, Christies, London, Dec. 16, 1949; Leger Fallery, London; Newhouse Galleries, New York, 1954; Walter P.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric. The pendants remained with the artist until his death and were sold from his estate in Paris in 1764. Jefferson C.

There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin.

Chrysler, Jr., 83.586 Reference: Sokolowski, _CM_, 1983, pp. 12-13. Auctioned in London in 1973 from the English parish of All-Hallows-Berkyngechirche-by-the-Tower, this panel is one of the most handsome early Netherlandish paintings to have come to light in recent years. The style of the painting - its meticulous realism and sense of calm, the noble stasis and solidity of its forms which are modeled softly in light - has been attributed to Gerard David, the last of the great fifteenth century artists. Trained quite probably in Haarlem in the northern Netherlands, David moved south to more cosmopolitan Bruges by 1484, the year he joined that citys painters guild. His eclectic, revivalist style, which took much from Jan van Eyck and the other great founders of the Flemish _ars mova_, quickly found favor in Bruges, and after Hans Memlings death in 1494, David became the citys leading painter. In 1501 he was made dean of the Bruges painters guild. _Christ on the Cross between Saints John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi_ has been dated around 1484-92, at the outset of Davids career in Bruges. As Diane Scillia has noted, the figure of Christ -- ultimately Eyckian in inspiration -- follows the design of the crucified Savior in Davids roughly contemporary _Calvary_ painting in Lugano (Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection), while the characterization of Saint John the Baptist recalls the same figure in Memlings _Altarpiece of John Donne_ of ca. 1480 in the National Gallery, London. The painting is not an illustration of the historic movement of the Crucifixion, but a meditative image of Christ on the Cross that transcends time and place. It is a symbol of Christs sacrifice and the promise of salvation that he offers. At left, John the Baptist preaches the advent of Christ: one mightier than I cometh (Luke 3:16). At right, Francis of Assisi (d. 1226), founder of the Franciscan order, displays the stigmata, which symbolize the transforming power of the Christian faith. The message of divine promise -- and of promise fulfilled -- receives triumphant, if delicately understated, expression in the tiny window of the building in the background at left. There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin. The presence of John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi suggests that the work was intended for a chapel dedicated to the veneration of those saints. The distant cityscape -- similar to that in the background of Davids _Nativity_in Budapest (Museum of Fine Arts) and quite possibly a depiction of an actual Flemish town -- may well include the monastery or castle for which the picture was made.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2046a-c Toward the end of his life, the Impressionist painter Renoir collaborated with Richard Guino in the production of a small number of bronze sculptures. The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Already in ancient Greek literature of the eighth century B.C. -- and particularly in Hesiods Theogony -- Greeces Mount Helicon was identified as the sacred abode of the nine goddesses of poetry and song, the Muses. There, joined sometimes by Apollo -- the god of music -- the Muses danced, sang and inspired mortal singers and poets with their music and sprigs of laurel. Mentioned, too, as a source of poetic inspriation were the waters of Helicons fountain of Hippocrene, which according to Ovid, gushed forth from the hoofmarks of the winged horse Pegasus. Heemskerck envisions Helicon as an idyllic, tree-shaded paradise, an antique pleasure garden set with statues and littered with books and musical instruments. He alludes to the creation of Hippocrene in an ingenious way, portraying Pegasus as a monumental bronze statue and the fountain as a spray of water issuing from its strut. The two male figures standing at right are poets who have received inspiration and been crowned with laurel. Other mortal pilgrims promenade, pick flowers or bathe in Hippocrenes inspiring waters, while above them putti hover, waiting to bestow more crowns of laurel. With an informality typical of the age, Heemskerck chooses not to identify the Muses by their traditional attributes. So casual is his approach that it is difficult even to locate all nine of the goddesses. Four of them have gathered to sing and make music at the positive organ at left, its bellows worked by a mischievous putto. A pair are seated at right, and two more join Apollo -- kneeling, with his lyre in hand -- in the central middleground. The remaining Muse has merged with the crowd of pilgrims beyond. A recent study of the paintings underdrawing using infrared reflectography has revealed an interesting detail: Heemskerck initially sketched two bearded, male heads at the extreme left of the composition, where he later chose to paint the standing nude Muse. The High Renaissance image of Apollo and the Muses was perfected in early sixteenth-century Italy, where Raphaels Vatican PARNASSUS fresco of 1510-11 was profoundly influential. By the 1540s, French and Flemish artists had also begun to interpret the subject. Among contemporary north Netherlandish painters, Heemskerck seems to have been the principal champion of the theme. In 1549 he designed an etching of APOLLO AND THE MUSES and around 1555 returned to the subject in a painting today in the New Orleans Museum of Art.

Chief among the sixteenth-century Netherlandish proponenets of Italian style (cf. nos 9, 15) was the Haarlem painter Maerten van Heemskerck. Between 1532 and 1537 he visited Rome, where he made drawings of antique sculpture and architecture and was affected by the late Mannerist aesthetic of the painters Francisco Salviati and Jacopino del Conte. He returned to Haarlem a convert to Italian art and by mid-century had become the most prominent of Italianate painters working in the northern Netherlands. Heemskerck produced mostly relgious images - altarpieces and devotional panels for the Catholic churches of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft. But he also created a remarkable number of mythological and allegorical paintings that revealed his interest in humanistic themes.

Chrysler, Jr. 89.57 Reference: Albert Ch√¢telet, _Early Dutch Painting: Painting in the Northern Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century_, New York, 1981: 233-234, no. 127-A. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the scholar Max J. Friedl√§nder identified a stylistically similar group of paintings and woodcuts that he credited to an unknown late-fifteenth-century Netherlandish artist. He called the painter the Master of the _Virgo inter Virgines_, a pseudonym he derived from one of the artists most famous pictures, the _Virgo inter Virgines_, or _Madonna and Child with Female Saints_, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Since the Masters woodcuts appear in books published in Delft between 1483 and 1498, it is generally assumed that he practiced in that city during the final quarter of the fifteenth century. Scholars have sometimes attempted to identify him with either of two documented Delft painters of the period- Pieter die Maelre or Dirc Jansz- but these identifications remain hypothetical. In his later works the Master devised an eccentric, expressive late Gothic style that recalls the paintings of his contemporaries, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These highly emotional, angst-ridden works are often marked by violently animated figures and unsettling anecdotal details. Even in his somewhat quieter and more austere early works, like the _Crucifixion_ of c. 1480, the Masters expressionism is already apparent in the pungent characterization of his doll-like figures - in the sharply linear rendering of their gaunt, bony forms and disquieting facial features, in the agitated calligraphy of their densely folded draperies. The style and dimensions of the _Crucifixion_ correspond almost exactly to two other panels by the Master, a _Lamentation_ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a _Resurrection_ in Amsterdams Rijksmuseum. It is often suggested that all three panels originally belonged to the same altarpiece, a small Passion polyptych. In this, scholars speculate, the _Crucifixion_ and _Lamentation_ would have functioned together as the centerpiece and the _Resurrection_ as the right shutter. The panel that is presumed to have served as the left shutter has yet to be discovered. In the _Crucifixion_ the weeping holy woman at the far left brings to mind particularly the female figures in the paintings of the Masters Flemish contemporary, Petrus Christus. The armor-clad man at lower right, prayerfully attending the crucified Christ with a hand raised to his heart, seems to have been depicted in a more individualized manner than his neighbors and may portray the paintings donor.

As an artist, he thrived on recording the many gestures and poses of its sinewy ballet dancers, whether adored and elegant in a performance, hard at work in rehearsal, or depleted and anonymous backstage. These often-unglamorous images appear in his paintings, pastels, prints, and sculpture, and constitute at least half of his mature work. In Dancer with Bouquets a prima ballerina stands before a painted backdrop and curtsies to her audience. She raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd. At her feet rest bouquets tossed by her admirers. A harsh glare from the footlights illuminates her figure, revealing her rather inelegant profile and giving the painting a sense of frank immediacy. The same stage lighting gives her diaphanous skirt a gauzy, indistinct appearance so favored by the Impressionists. The heavy lines used to indicate the dancers limbs became more common in Degas work as his eyesight began to fail. Pentimenti-areas of the composition subsequently altered and painted over, yet visible today-can be seen along the contours of the dancers face and arms, indicating that Degas reworked the figure considerably.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1895-1917; the artists family, 1917-1918; Degas sale, Georges Petit, Paris, May 4, 1918; J.

Edgar Degas was most widely known in his lifetime, and is beloved today particularly, as a painter of the dance. Already in 1867, in his _Mlle Fiocre in the Ballet from La Source_ (Brooklyn Museum), he had begun to interpret subjects drawn from the ballet of the Paris Op√©ra. He continued to do so - in hundreds of paintings, sculptures, pastels and prints - for the next forty years. In the nineteenth century the ballet was one of the prime cultural diversions of the Parisian upper class. Degas fascination may have been fostered at an early age by his father, a wealthy Paris banker who was deeply interested in music and surely held a subscription, or _abonnement_, to the Op√©ra. Degas chose for his subjects not merely the seasoned stars of the Op√©ra stage, like the dancer portrayed in The Chrysler Museum picture, but the lesser ranks of the _corps de ballet_ and even the adolescent apprentices, the _petits rats_. He showed dancers in performance, at rest or in transit backstage, and at work in the rehearsal hall, moving their often reluctant bodies through endless hours of exercise at the barre. In the discipline of the dance Degas may have sensed a metaphor for his own lifelong quest for aesthetic control. More important to the Impressionist Degas, however; was the opportunity the ballet offered to research the transitory effects of gesture and motion, the dynamics of human movement. _Dancer with Bouquets_ was produced late in Degas career - around 1895-1900, when his eyesight was failing and he had begun to work in broader, more vigorous strokes. In the painting a prima ballerina takes a bow at the end of a performance: at her feet are bouquets of flowers tossed by an adoring audience. Standing before a painted landscape backdrop, he raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd before her. The footlights, which fill the scene with a magical, if rather harsh, incandescence, transform the gauzy layers of her gown into a smoldering violet-grey cloud. Though painted on a large, official scale - unusual for the late Degas - _Dancer with Bouquets_ was not exhibited during the artists lifetime, but remained in his studio, where it served as a model for other works. The dancers pose was also used in one of Degas later sculptures, _The Bow_ of c. 1896. The _pentimenti_ visible along the contours of the dancers face and arms indicate that Degas reworked her pose considerably. There are at least four preparatory studies for the figure. One, a half-length _√©tude_ in pastel, was included in the second Degas atelier sale in Paris in December of 1918. The remaining three - full-length figure studies in charcoal and pastel and yet another half-length sketch in charcoal - were dispersed in 1919 at the third of the posthumous Degas sales. In _Dancer with Bouquets_ the scene is viewed obliquely, as if from the wings or a private side box. The odd angle of the viewers vantage point and the tricks it plays with perspective and the dancers pose are typical of Degas later, more abstracted compositions. The sharply lighted, unlovely features of the aging dancers face and the sense of motion arrested create and image of nearly photographic frankness and immediacy - an unstudied snapshot of reality stolen from the flow of time.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.716 Drawn from ancient Greek mythology, the pastoral love story of Daphnis and Chlo√´ was a favorite of 19th-century French academic painters. According to the story, the two were thrown together in infancy and nursed by a sheep and cow. They were soon taken in by a shepherd and his wife and spent a carefree childhood together watching over their stepparents flock. They eventually fell in love with each other and married. Vibert depicts the enchanted moment when childhood gives way to the first stirrings of love, as Daphnis teaches Chlo√´ to play the shepherds flute. The event unfolds in an idyllic forest glade carpeted with grass and flowers, an earthly paradise where all is gentleness and innocence. Vibert exhibited the painting in Paris at the 1866 Salon, and though many praised the work, the twenty-six-year-old artist soon abandoned ambitious mythological subjects like Daphnis and Chlo√´ for small-scale scenes of the Catholic clergy. These light-hearted satires of the religious life proved immensely popular, and with them Vibert became one of the best-known artists of the late 19th century.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

According to Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (2:401-465), Diana, the Roman goddess of the chase and protectress of women, required that the nymphs who attended her on her hunts in Arcadia be chaste. One of them, the beautiful Callisto, had the misfortune to catch Jupiters eye while she was hunting alone in the forest. Disguised as Diana, Jupiter came to her and seduced her. Upon her return to Dianas camp, Callisto reluctantly disrobed to bathe along with the other nymphs and was discovered to be pregnant. Enraged at Callistos transgression, Diana drove her away. This dramatic moment of banishment is the subject David Wilkie depicted in his painting of _Diana and Callisto_. A lofty historical subject drawn from classical mythology, the theme of Diana and Callisto was an unusual one for the Scottish-born Wilkie. Moving to London in 1805, he achieved fame there primarily as a portraitist and painter of earthy, humorous genre images like his well-known _Blind Fiddler_ (Tate Gallery, London). But _Diana and Callisto_ was produced at the beginning of Wilkies career, in 1803-04, when the nineteen-year-old artist was still a student at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and had not yet freed himself from the academic interests of his teacher, John Graham. Under Grahams direction, the Academy held a yearly competition among its students for the best history painting. In 1803 the contest subject was Diana and Castillo; Wilkie submitted the present painting and with it won the first prize of nine pounds in early 1804. Wilkie clearly intended to depict the elevated theme of Diana and Callisto in a suitably serious, idealizing style. Nevertheless, there is much in the painting - for example, the powerful and highly individualized facial expressions of Diana and her nymphs - that forecasts the pithy naturalism of the artists mature genre pictures. Writing about _Diana and Callisto_ in 1848, John Burnet remarked that the close observation of nature [in the painting] was apparent, however inappropriate to the higher walks of art....[Callisto] was made to blush with so deep a colour in the ear and upper part of the neck as gave Graham an opportunity...for descanting on the difficulty of introducing the peculiarities of familiar life into the higher branches of art. Wilkies preliminary compositional study for _Diana and Callisto_ rendered in black and red chalk, is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. Jefferson C.

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

The vacationers here are not wealthy folk in elegant seaside attire, but ordinary working people enjoying a day off. Like the other French Neo-Impressionists, Henri Edmond Cross was a political leftist who championed the rights of the laboring classes. In paintings like Excursion he created an idealized vision of French society in which labor, the arts, and leisure combined to form a utopian view of modern life. The young Cross arrived in Paris in 1881 and soon befriended the painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, the first practitioners of Neo-Impressionism. Their deliberate dotted painting technique involved the methodical placement of tiny pinpoints of color. In 1892-a year after Seurats death-Cross and Signac settled in Provence, in the South of France. There, inspired by the vibrant light and radiant hues of the Mediterranean coast, Cross produced his most ambitious works in the Neo-Impressionist style, chief among them Excursion.","Provenance":"Cross atelier sale, Hotel Drouot, Oct. 28, 1921 (cat. no. 27); Dr. Roudinesco, Paris; Walter P.

Chrysler, Jr., 77.416 Reference: Isabelle Compin, _H.E. Cross_, Paris, 1964, pp. 135-136, no. 45. Like his colleague Paul Signac (no. 122), Henri Edmond Cross played a key role in the development of Neo-Impressionism following the death of the movements founder, Georges Seurat, in 1891. Born the son of a Douai ironmonger, Cross arrived in Paris by 1881 to conclude his art studies with the painters Emile Dupont-Zipcy and Fran√ßois Bonvin. As an inaugural member of the progressive Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Cross met Seurat and Signac at the founding of that institution in 1884, though he did not fully adopt their dotted painting method - divisionism - for another seven years (see no. 122). By 1892 both Cross and Signac had left Paris and settled in Provence, Cross at Saint-Clair and Signac at nearby Saint-Tropez. Stimulated by the warming radiance and boisterous colors of the Mediterranean coast, they gradually renounced the constraints of Seurats optical theories and densely granulated brush technique. In a series of light-soaked, arcadian landscapes, they evolved a more vibrant divisionist method, painting in progressively broader blocks of brilliant color. Their research was already well advanced by 1895, as seen in Cross imposing _Excursion_ of that year. In time their style would have a profound influence on the art of the young Henri Matisse and his fellow Fauves (nos. 132, 128), who frequently visited Saint-Tropez around 1904 to study with Signac and Cross. One of Cross most complex figurative landscapes, _Excursion_ depicts a carefree group of summer holiday makers as they relax on a windswept bluff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The paintings arcardian mood evokes the eighteenth-century _f√™tes galantes_ of Antoine Watteau. Its decorative surface patterns - its sweeping curves and arabesques - bring to mind the contemporary work of the Nabis. The subdued color scheme of pink, mauve, green and light blue captures perfectly the sun-bleached palette of Provence. Indeed, Cross noted as he worked on the picture that it would require tints compatible with a sunny plain - not too rich, but more neutral and grey in tone. The _Excursion_ was largely finished by December of 1894, when fellow-divisionist Maximilien Luce mentioned it in a letter to Cross: Signac has told me about a painting of yours that he likes very much (the excursionists); from his description it sounds very interesting. While on display in Paris at the 1895 Salon des Ind√©pendants, the work was viewed by Camille Pissarro (no. 96), who referred to it in an April 8 letter to his son Lucien, and by Signac, who recorded his impressions of it in the April 26 entry of his journal. The painting remained with Cross until his death and was sold at the 1921 auction of his atelier. Three preliminary works survive: a pencil sketch for the standing female figure (Cabinet des dessins, Louvre, Paris), a large compositional study in oil (Petit Palais, Mus√©e dArt Moderne, Geneva) and a smaller oil sketch of the landscape (private collection, Paris).

Like his colleague Bouguereau (no. 87), G√©r√¥me was a standard-bearer of the French academic style, a conservative grand master who carried the hallowed traditions of Davidian classicism into the second half of the nineteenth century. Like Bouguereau, too, he was one of the most influential artists of his day. For a full forty years (1863-1904) he served as a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his impeccable professional credentials drew generations of students, many of the Americans, to his atelier. G√©r√¥me achieved his greatest fame as an interpreter of Orientalist subjects (see nos. 76, 88). In the years after 1853 he traveled repeatedly to North Africa and the Near East - he visited Egypt alone seven times - and he devoted more and more of his art to genre images of Arab life. These works offered a more balanced and realistic portrayal of contemporary Egypt and Arabia than had earlier Romantics like Delacroix (no. 76). However, in the clarity and polish of their brushwork - in their careful crafting of detail and draftsmanly precision - G√©r√¥mes Orientalist pictures remained thoroughly academic. G√©r√¥me made his earliest tour of Egypt in 1856. He spent half of his eight-month visit in Cairo and the other half navigating the Nile, sketching the fabled waterway and its exotic river traffic. Thereafter the Nile became a favored setting for his Egyptian genre pieces, as can be seen in the well-known _Excursion of the Harem_ of 1869, in which a delicate private pleasure craft ferries a sultans seraglio along the river. G√©r√¥me exhibited the painting at the Salon of 1869, where it was warmly received. The Empress Eug√©nie, wife of Napoleon III, hoped to buy it but demurred when told its price - 30,000 francs. After viewing the _Excursion_, the critic Th√©ophile Gautier marveled at its atmospheric and luminary subtleties: The boat slips over the clear transparent water, along the misty shore in a sort of luminous fog which produces a magical effect. The bark seems to float at the same time in the water and in the air....the delicate tones of the land of light are rendered by Monsieur G√©r√¥me with absolute fidelity. A recent cleaning of the painting has once again revealed its luminous palette of mauve and violet hues. The work must also have appealed to the young American Thomas Eakins, who studied with G√©r√¥me from 1866 to 1869 and whose Philadelphia sculling pictures of the early 1870s owe an obvious debt to G√©r√¥mes _Excursion_ and other Egyptian river scenes.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2041A and 71.2041B, respectively Antoine Coysevox was a leading sculptor of Louis XIVs reign and a major interpreter of the Sun Kings Baroque court style. After studying at the Acad√©mie Royale, he was named royal _sculpteur_ in 1666. With the assistance of Louis all-powerful first painter, Charles Le Brun, he was made a professor at the Acad√©mie in 1678. Soon after he joined in the sculptural decoration of Versailles. His subsequent career was one of unbroken ascent. Royal commissions and court requests for portrait busts and statues, for funerary moments and ch√¢teau decorations followed one another in rapid succession, and in 1702 Coysevox was named director of the Acad√©mie. Perhaps the most renowned sculptures of Coysevoxs career were the monumental equestrian marble groups of _Fame_ and _Mercury_ that he produced in 1701-02 for the terrace of the Abreuvoir (horses watering pond) at Louis ch√¢teau at Marly. The pendants, which were moved in 1719 to the Tuileries gardens in Paris, were widely acclaimed. The king rewarded Coysevox with an annual pension of 4000 _livres), the largest yearly stipend he ever granted to an artist in his employ. In the years after 1702 Coysevox and his followers were called upon to issue numerous small replicas in bronze, among them the pair in The Chrysler Museum. Soaring aloft on the winged Pegasus, the female figure of Fame blows upon her horn, while her companion Mercury rides heavenward on his own winged mount. The political import of these allegorical pendants is made clear in the imagery decorating their struts. Each bears a breastplate on which Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, entrusts the female personification of France to Louis XIV. The image underscores Louis absolute power as guardian and ruler of France and his divine right as king. As Pegasus leaps skyward with the trumpeting figure of Fame, it is the kings own ascent to greatness and immortality that is celebrated. As emissary of the gods, Mercury carries the same divinely-sanctioned message heavenward. Jefferson C.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2060 Like his older colleagues Charles Vernet-Lecomte, Charles Chaplin, and L√©on Perrault, Jacquet was a standard bearer of the conservative academic-classical style in late-19th-century Paris. A pupil of the French academic master William Bouguereau, he perfected a tight, enameled painting technique which he brought to bear on a range of traditional subjects-portraits, historical costume pieces, sensual female nudes, and sentimental genre images like Girl Minstrel. Between 1864 and his death in 1909, he exhibited his work regularly at the Paris Salon, and by the 1890s he was one of the citys most esteemed and widely known painters. Yet with the triumph of modernist painting in the early 20th century, his reputation rapidly declined, and by the 1920s he was all but forgotten. One of the loveliest of Jacquets works, Girl Minstrel coyly captures the melancholy predicament of a young waif who must fend for herself in a harsh world. Dressed in rags and rough homespun, she holds a hurdy-gurdy, a musical instrument long associated in European art with gypsies and the lower classes. As with the paintings by Chaplin and Perrault nearby, Jacquets sentimental subject is little more than a pretext for presenting a suggestive image of an attractive and vulnerable young girl in need of rescue.

The top of the door jamb curves rather than meet at a 90 degree angle. The stonework tracery above the door is very thick. The outer portion of a carving begins as a gothic pointed arch; as the carving moves toward the interior, the arch looks like the ogee shape. There are two figures carved into the stone. The man on the left wears tights and a doublet, his hair is straight cut just at ear level. The man on the right wears boots, short pants, a coat and a small round cap. He holds a bag full of something, possibly money. His hair is shoulder length. There was once an image in between the two men, centrally located over the door. It has broken away and there is no indication of what it might have been.

In some instances decoration took the form of figurative scenes drawn from the Bible, illustrating the age-old Christian themes of sin and salvation. In other cases, as with the column capital at left, decoration was more purely ornamental, meant simply to enliven the architecture and give rein to the artists imagination and sense of play. The two male figures crowning the doorway here are too worn to be clearly identified. The figure at right appears to hold a moneybag, perhaps indicating that the door once served as an entrance to a mercantile exchange, or that it illustrated a subject such as the biblical parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Without the sculptural element that initially served as centerpiece-its form sheered away-we are left to speculate about the doors original intent and location. Yet we can still admire the elaborately carved Gothic tracery and foliate frieze, and the solid, well-formed figures, all of which give presence and even grandeur to this modest portal.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2063 The provenance (collection history) of Chaplins Ha√Ød√©e is typical of the fate of many French academic paintings in the 20th century and says much about the vagaries of artistic fashion. Celebrated in his day for his paintings of beautiful women and the female nude, Chaplin completed Ha√Ød√©e in 1873 and unveiled it that same year at the Paris Salon. The painting, which coyly depicts the heroine of Lord Byrons epic poem Don Juan, was purchased from the artist by Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, an important New York collector of French painting who in 1887 bequeathed her entire collection, including Ha√Ød√©e, to the newly-founded Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met retained Ha√Ød√©e through the first half of the 20th century, a time when the critical opinion of 19th-century French academic art had begun to slide. With the triumph of the Abstract Expressionists and other American avant-garde artist groups in the mid-1950s, traditional academic art seemed permanently discredited. And in 1956 the Met decided to remove Ha√Ød√©e and scores of other 19th-century pictures from its collection. Soon after, Chaplins painting was auctioned in New York and purchased by Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. Chrysler shrewdly sensed an opportunity in this long-neglected area of the art market and during the 1950s had begun to acquire major examples of 19th-century French academic painting at historically low prices. (He paid $325 for Ha√Ød√©e.) His instincts proved right. By the mid-1970s, French academic art was once more on the rise, and today it represents one of the most active, and lucrative, segments of the international art market.

In 1733 he moved to Boston, where he established himself as an artisan, working as a glazier and a painter of houses and signs. Around 1740 he began to paint portraits as well. Like many Boston portrait limners of the day, Badger based his simple, forthright style upon the portraiture of John Smibert and Robert Feke and derived many of his compositions from European portrait prints. During the 1750s he was Bostons principal face painter and New Englands best-known artist. After 1760, however, his influence waned rapidly with the emergence of John Singleton Copley and his more sophisticated portrait art (no. 59). During his career Badger painted more than a hundred portraits, many of them likenesses of small children. A mature production of c. 1760, _Jemima Flucker_ possesses that quality of naive charm - the sweetness and fragility - which Badger typically bestowed upon his youngest sitters. The girl is dressed in a blue satin frock trimmed in white and tied loosely at the waist with a pink satin sash. The floral spray in her hair is probably a piece of jewelry, a delicate enamel and silver ornament called a _tremblant_ (a French term that alludes to the fact that the ornament trembled, and shimmered, when the wearer moved). In her right hand she holds a sprig of cherries and on her left, a pet bird. As was often the case when Badger painted children, Jemima Flucker is shown out-of-doors, her full-length form placed directly before the viewer in the foreground of a hilly landscape. The tree that frames the composition at left is almost a Badger signature, a landscape device that occurs throughout his portraiture. A resident of Boston and Cambridge, Jemima Flucker reportedly lived to the age of ninety-five and bequeathed the portrait to her only daughter Elizabeth Child, who was born in 1779. The painting remained in the possession of Jemima Fluckers descendants until 1947. The Chrysler Museum also possesses a letter written by Jemima Flucker to Elizabeth on June 15, 1795. Jefferson C.

Th√©odore Rousseau was a founding member of the Barbizon group of artists (nos. 72, 77, 80, 89, 103, 112) and one of the most esteemed landscape painters in mid-nineteenth-century France. In the late 1820s he was already at work at Chailly, near the Fontainebleau Forest. There, and on subsequent visits to the Auvergne (1830) and Normandy (1831), he produced a revolutionary series of vibrant and spontaneous _plein-air_ landscapes, pure landscapes that dispensed with traditional narrative subject matter and classical compositional schemes. Rousseaus subsequent career in Paris was a constant struggle against the conservative forces of the Salon and Acad√©mie Royale. Between 1836 and 1841 his paintings were consistently rejected by Salon juries, a cruel example of official persecution that earned him the sardonic soubriquet, _le grande refus√©_. In 1841 the frustrated Rousseau turned his back on the Salon, where he did not exhibit again until 1849. The years of rejection had their effect on the artist, who took care after 1850 to produce landscapes more in line with official taste. These composed and carefully worked pictures borrowed much from the landscape art of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. _A Clearing in the Forest of Fontainebleau_, one of several canvases that Rousseau undertook at Barbizon in 1860-62 is an impressive example of his mature, more finished and traditional style. Its composition and the handling of foliage recall particularly the works of the Dutch landscapist Meindert Hobbema. the site depicted may be the _Carrefour de la Reine Blanche_ (The Crossroads of the White Queen), a glade in the forest near Barbizon. The site was a favorite of Rousseaus. Three of his other paintings show the same spot; the best known of these is in the Louvre, Paris.

Such paintings were often collaborative efforts. The central figurative scene was typically executed by a history painter adept at figure composition, while the wreath of flowers was supplied by a still-life specialist. The Museums example was painted in Antwerp in 1651 by one of the most inspired of these Flemish collaborative teams: the history painter Erasmus II Quellinus and the still-life specialist Jan Philips van Thielen, both of whom signed the painting. During their 20-year collaboration, Quellinus and Van Thielen produced a number of garland paintings featuring trompe loeil (illusionistic) stone sculptures set in elaborate sculpted frames, or cartouches, and surrounded by flowers. Acquired in London in 1994, the present painting is among the most ambitious of these and also one of the largest; it measures more than four by three feet and is painted on a single sheet of copper measuring less than a quarter of an inch in thickness. At the center Quellinus depicts grisaille (unpainted) sculptures of the Virgin and Infant Christ subduing the serpent. In its mouth the serpent clutches the apple of original sin. Quellinus sets the figures in an elaborate Baroque cartouche crowned at the upper corners with a pair of pelicans. These ancient symbols of selfless love refer to Christs sacrifice on the cross. Van Thielen weaves the cartouche with ivy, an emblem of eternal life through Christ, and a brilliant halo of blooms - roses, jasmine, snow drops, tulips, nasturtium, apple blossoms and anemones, which symbolize the virtues of the Virgin and Child and pay tribute to their holiness. The flowers are enlivened with moths and butterflies, which allude to Christs resurrection. Before the Museum purchased the painting, the collection contained no still life produced before the mid-18th century. Thus, the painting filled a major gap in the collection and enriches the Museums presentation of 17th-century Catholic art and thought.

Moreland_ _1792_ Gift of Morrie A. Moss, 74.5.2 An artistic prodigy, George Morland was already exhibiting drawings at Londons Royal Academy by the age of ten. The elder Morland - a painter and an art dealer who restored Old Master pictures - was cynically aware of the commercial value of his sons precocious talent, and he pushed him to perfect his craft. While apprenticed to his father in 1777-84, the boy was kept perpetually busy. He made drawings for sale and copied the popular landscapes of Joseph Vernet and the Dutch and Flemish paintings that his father restored in his studio. Once free of his father, Morland rejected the strict discipline of his early years and embraced a life of reckless self-indulgence. Despite his increasingly dissolute ways, he produced a remarkable number of pictures. Many of them were cosigned to unscrupulous art dealers who systematically underpaid him and kept him in debt. He died, alcoholic and debt-ridden, at the age of forty-one. During the later 1780s Morland specialized in moralizing genre paintings of upper-middle class life and in fashionable, sentimental pictures of children at play. After 1790 he turned almost exclusively to picturesque scenes of English country life - interiors of stables and landscapes with gypsies, smugglers and peasants. These subjects were determined partly by the Dutch paintings he had first encountered in his fathers shop and partly by the coastal scenes of Vernet and Philipp de Loutherbourg. Influential, too, were the contemporary landscape styles of Thomas Gainsborough (no. 58) and the French rococo masters. With his landscapes Morland forged a vision of rustic English life that affected native artists for generations. The finest works of Morlands uneven career were his country scenes of the early 1790s. Among them is _A View of Westmorland_ of 1792, which reveals the artist at the height of his powers. Here an apparently innocent genre interlude is made the pretext for a stunning evocation of the English coast. The painting depicts a peasant family proceeding toward the shore where two men await them in a boat. The rather anxious, covert glance of the woman suggests that she and her family are actually involved in the not so innocent act of smuggling contraband, an activity often depicted in Morlands landscapes. Though the figures possess the solidity and the mass of seventeenth-century Dutch masters, the landscape itself, evoked in fluid strokes, is a lush tribute to the rococo. Jefferson C.

The crisis came at the 1835 Paris Salon where Gros exhibited Acis and Galatea. He had completed it two years before in memory of his beloved teacher, Jacques-Louis David (d. 1825). The critical response was devastating, and soon thereafter, Gros drowned himself in the Seine.","Provenance":"The artist, 1833-1835; the artists atelier sale, Paris, Nov. 23, 1835 (cat. no. 22); Urvoy de Saint Bedan, Paris, 1835-1863; Jean-Baptiste Delestre, Paris, 1863-71; Delestre sale, Paris, Oct. 13-14, 1871 (cat. no. 3); M.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2080 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 16. Gros originally achieved fame in Paris as one of Napoleons principal painters, glorifying the emperor and his military exploits in a series of vast, heroic canvases. In these works he employed a style inspired less by the Neoclassicism of his revered teacher Jacques-Louis David than by the paintings of Rubens (no. 16), which he had studied during his years in Italy (1793-1800). Gros style, with its passionate emotion and vibrant colors, was hailed by the rising generation of French Romantic painters. The most famous of his Napoleonic history paintings, _The Pesthouse at Jaffa_ (Louvre, Paris), was the highlight of the 1804 Salon; with it, Gros reputation was secured. Despite his success, Gros became increasingly worried that he had abandoned the lofty principles of Davids art for what he called the impertinence and vagabondage of Romantic style, and with Davids death in 1825, he sensed the need to return to an art more strictly aligned to the Neoclassicism of his former mentor. This reversion to an older, and no longer fashionable, manner isolated Gros from many of his earlier supporters, and his art became the object of mounting criticism. The crisis came at the 1835 Salon. There Gros exhibited two works of decidedly classical style and subject matter - _Hercules and Diomedes_ (Mus√©e des Augustins, Toulouse) and _Acis and Galatea_, which the artist had painted in Davids memory two years before. The devastating critical response caused Gros to fall into a deep depression, and, soon thereafter, he drowned himself in the Seine. Today Gros is rightly recognized as the crucial link between the austere and learned classicism of his teacher David and the more colorful Romanticism of...Delacroix (Francis Broun). Gros took the mythological subject of _Acis and Galatea_ from a passage in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (13:738-897). In it the nymph Galatea is courted by the hideous Cyclops, Polyphemus, whose love she spurns for that of the shepherd Acis. To proclaim his love, the Cyclops makes music upon his pipes, while Acis and Galatea hide nearby listening. The giant soon spies the pair and, raging with jealousy, crushes Acis beneath a boulder. In Gros painting the terror-stricken lovers, concealed in a cave at waters edge, cower at the approach of Polyphemus, who stalks the countryside blowing his horn. Gros critics balked at the paintings melodramatic tone. They complained, too, that its figures lacked grace, but conceded that they were effectively drawn. In truth, both figures were modeled upon antique sculptural prototypes: Galateas pose recalls that of the so-called Crouching Aphrodite, while Acis suggests the stance of a combative Hercules. The painting and two preliminary drawings (locations unknown) were dispersed during the posthumous sale of Gros studio in November of 1835. In 1863 the picture was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Del√®stre, a former student of Gros who authored the first biography of the artist. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr., 78.294 Reference: Giovanni Previtali. _La Pitura del Cinquecento a Napoli nel Vicereame_. Turin, 1978, p. 19. The Neapolitan school of painting began its rise to international prominence somewhat belatedly, in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Previously Naples had been a provincial art center, its painters influenced and overshadowed by the traditionally more progressive schools of Florence and Rome. As did many of his sixteenth-century colleagues, the Neapolitan Criscuolo no doubt visited Rome. There, his art was transformed by Raphaels High Renaissance paintings and by the Mannerist works of Raphael followers like Perino del Vaga. Returning to Naples, he devised a version of Roman Mannerism that made him one of the mores sophisticated painters in that still parochial center. As his career progressed, Criscuolo - and the Neapolitan school with him - embraced more fully the tenets of the Roman and Florentine high _maniera_ (later Mannerist style), prompted no doubt by visits from itinerant painters like Giorgio Vasari in 1544. A work of Crisculos early post-Roman maturity, the undated _Adoration of the Magi_ has been placed by scholars in the mid-1540s on the strength of its strong stylistic resemblance to the artists 1545 _Adoration with the Trinity_ in the Museo e Gallerie Nazionali di Capodimonte, Naples. In the _Adoration of the Magi_, Criscuolo reshapes the art of Perino del Vaga in more current _maniera_ style, creating an elegant image of self conscious grace, of characteristically compressive _maniera_ forms and surface suavity. The artists essentially two dimensional design is particularly pronounced in the forms of the three kings, which have been flattened against the picture plane in a dense pattern of sinuous line and shifting color and texture. As they present their gifts to the Child, the three kings - the young Moor Balthasar, the middle-aged Melchior and the grey bearded Caspar - proclaim the allegiance of all earthly rulers to the divine King of Kinds. Symbolizing this act of fealty is the crown that the eldest magus has pulled from his head and placed on the steps beneath Christs feet. Its piers crumbling and overgrown with vines, the architectural ruin behind the Holy Family serves as a venerable Christian symbol for the old Jewish law, which was destroyed by the coming of Christ. Though based ultimately on High Renaissance canons, the faces and forms of Virgin and child have been keyed to a sharper _maniera_ pitch and, thus, exhibit a more rarified and eccentric kind of beauty. Remarkable, too, are Criscuolos palette of acidic blues, greens and yellows and the snarling griffin carved from the leg of Christs throne. Criscuolos paintings are rare in American collections, and the _Adoration of the Magi_ offers a unique and exceptionally fine example of provincial Italian response to Roman high style in the mid-sixteenth century.

Together with Veronese and the aging Titian, Tintoretto was a presiding master of the Venetian school of painting in the second half of the sixteenth century. The sign over his studio door read the color of Titian, the drawing of Michelangelo. His bold combination of northern and central Italian techniques yielded a passionate and lyrical late Mannerist style that brought him countless private and public commissions in Venice. Despite surface abrasion and darkened pigments, Tintorettos inimitable painterly technique can be seen in his treatment of Floras left ankle formed by trails of phosphorescent white, and in the fluid, glazed golds of her luminous hair.","Provenance":"Painted ca. 1555 for the Palazzo Barbo, San Pantaleone, Venice (original location); Private collection, Southern France, 1957; Newhouse Galleries, 1958; Walter P.

Together with Veronese (no. 13) and the aging Titian, Tintoretto presided over the Venetian school of painting during the second half of the sixteenth century. His style was formed by Michelangelo, the Venetian Mannerists and Titian, to whom he may have been apprenticed. From them he forged an art of violent energy and monumental sweep, a passionate late Mannerist style marked by an astonishing technical freedom. Tintoretto and his many assistants worked almost continuously on large-scale commissions for Venetian churches, palaces, charitable confraternities and government buildings, covering acres of wall and ceiling with a feverish velocity that dumbfounded his rivals. As had the classical writers and artists who influenced them so profoundly, sixteenth-century European painters frequently used the cycle of the seasons as a metaphor for the eternal passage of time. Their paintings of the seasons were often produced in sets of four, with each picture featuring a male or female figure who personified the particular season with the help of appropriate seasonal attributes. Following traditional practice, Tintoretto produced his _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ around 1555 as part of a series of four paintings of the seasons. Here, a lively and robust Flora, goddess of flowers and spring, shakes off the torpor of winter. The spray of flowers that seems to issue from her womb shows that she is fertile with the promise of new life. She is a splendid, full-bodied symbol of the generative power of the reawakening earth. Tintorettos companion pictures of _Summer_ and _Winter_ survive: the former is found in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the latter in a private collection in Bergamo. The concluding painting of _Autumn_ has yet to be recovered. The Chrysler Museum and National Gallery paintings were originally fitted with octagonal frames that covered their corners. The seventeenth-century biographer of Venetian artists, Carlo Ridolfi, noted in his _Le Maraviglie dellArte_ (1648) that Tintoretto produced a set of Seasons pictures as part of his decoration of a room in the Barbo Palace in Venice: In the Palazzo Barbo at San Pantaleone one sees in the panelling of one room a Capriccio of Dreams with some gods in heaven and various symbols of things that come into the minds of men while they are dreaming; in the surrounding area the Four Seasons are personified. Scholars have suggested that the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace was a ceiling painting and that it can be identified with a large, octagonal canvas by Tintoretto in the Detroit Institute of the Arts, the so-called _Dreams of Man_. It has also been proposed that the _Allegorical Figure of Spring_ and its three companion paintings are the Four Seasons that originally flanked the Capriccio of Dreams in the Barbo Palace, composing, perhaps, a frieze of paintings along the tops of the walls.

Some believe that these three men in Italian medieval and Renaissance dress-an architect, a monk, and a poet-are meant to portray specific, famous Italians-possibly the painter and architect Giotto, the Florentine firebrand Savonarola, and the creator of the Divine Comedy, Dante. Others have suggested that the figures should be viewed more broadly as allegorical embodiments of artistic, religious, and poetic inspiration-as personifications of the different aspects of Renaissance genius engaged in a colloquy on the nature of art and the spirit. Puvis painted this tribute to Italian greatness at the age of twenty-four, while visiting Rome in 1848. It was the young artists first major painting, and it clearly reflects his early interest in the robust, romantic art of Thomas Couture and Ary Scheffer. Puvis went on to achieve great fame in France for his large-scale mural paintings. Using an altogether different style marked by a flat, decorative approach to the human figure, he created in these works a pale and silent realm of motionless, columnar forms-a remote world of dreams that enchanted the Symbolists of the 1880s and 1890s. Yet even in early works like Allegory, we can trace the basic features of those mature works-their sense of mystery, gentle poetry, and contemplative calm.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"Signed and inscribed: Rome, 1848.","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr., 71.545 Reference: Harrison, _CM_, 1986, no. 41. The marine and landscape specialist Jongkind was, perhaps, the most important precursor of the French Impressionist school. He served as mentor to Eug√®ne Boudin (no. 109) and to the young Claude Monet, whom he encountered in Normandy in the summer of 1862 and impressed greatly with his sparkling _plein-air_ pen sketches and watercolors. From that time on, Monet wrote, he was my real master, and it was to him that I owed the final education of my eye. Born and trained initially in Holland, Jongkind arrived in Paris in 1846 and joined the atelier of the famous marine painter Eug√®ne Isabey. Within a year he was painting along the Normandy and Brittany coasts. He made his debut at the 1848 Salon, and though his works sold well, he was plagued by debts and was often deeply depressed. At his mothers death in 1855, Jongkind suffered a nervous collapse and withdrew to Holland, where he lived for five years as an impoverished semi-recluse. After his return to Paris in 1860, however, his fortunes brightened, largely through the efforts of his enthusiastic patron Th√©ophile Bascle and his new-found companion Josephine Fesser-Borrh√©e. By the mid-1860s Jongkind had reached his creative pinnacle, producing some of the most vibrant and spontaneous of his Pre-Impressionist landscapes. Among these mature works is the 1866 _Along the Ourcq_, which was apparently purchased from the artist by Bascle. The painting depicts the Ourcq canal, which lies just northeast of Paris. Since Mme Fesser-Borrh√©es brother-in-law lived near the canal, in the village of Pantin, Jongkind had ample opportunity to study and paint the waterway and its well-trodden towpaths. The Ourcq was, in fact, one of Jongkinds preferred sites in the mid-1860s, when he sketched and painted it repeatedly under varying atmospheric conditions - in sunlight, in moonlight, in the rain. An 1864 painting of the canal by Jongkind, today in the collection of Paul Mellon (Upperville, Virginia), and a watercolor view from the same year (private collection, Paris) directly anticipate the design of The Chrysler Museum canvas. Jongkind customarily composed his paintings in the studio, consulting sketches he had made _sur le motif_ (on the spot). Thought not painted out-of-doors, _Along the Ourcq_ nonetheless conveys the freshness and freedom of a rapidly executed _plein-air_ impression. These were the very qualities that attracted Monet and, as Boudin said, opened the door through which all the Impressionists passed. Jefferson C.

Others, like the Parisian sculptor Prosper dEpinay, held firm to the traditional tenets of academic classicism. The smooth, idealized forms, meticulously finished surface, and open sentimentality of DEpinays impressive marble group, Amor Forgiven, are typical of the kind of conservative, academic sculpture that dominated the Paris Salon in the final decades of the 19th century. Though this kind of sculpture fell out of fashion with the rise of modernist art in the early 20th century, it has recently returned to favor and is now avidly sought by collectors. Classical mythology is filled with stories about the love goddess Venus and her mischievous winged offspring Cupid, who often disobeyed his mother and aimed his arrows of love at the wrong targets. In DEpinays sculpture, Venus gathers her son in her arms, presumably forgiving him for one of his transgressions. DEpinays lighthearted mythological subject is largely a pretext for a fetching portrayal of a sensual female nude and cherubic child in playful embrace. The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923). By the mid-20th century it was owned by the family of Lydia Aspergren of Norfolk, who donated it to the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences in 1963. Kept largely in storage since then, the sculpture was recently cleaned for exhibit in Behind the Seen. Conservation Project After sitting in storage for decades, DEpinays Amor Forgiven was in need of a thorough surface cleaning. In August of 2005, sculpture conservator Andrew Baxter was contracted to clean the sculpture in time for its exhibition in Behind the Seen. Mr. Baxter began the process by dry cleaning the surface with a vacuum and erasures, removing as much grime as possible before moving on to soap and water. Using swabs and brushes, he next wet-cleaned the surface with a non-ionic soap. To draw out deeply embedded stains, he applied clay poultices to the surface. Once the cleaning process was complete, Mr. Baxter covered the surface with a protective coating of wax.","Provenance":"The sculpture was purchased from the artist by the famous Swedish opera soprano, Christine Nillson (1843-1923).

As did the other artists working on the series, Bonazza made preliminary models in terracotta before commencing work on the marbles themselves - including this one depicting the Annunciation, the miraculous moment when the Archangel Gabriel appears to the Virgin Mary and announces that she has been chosen by God to bear his son. The marble reliefs suffered considerable damage in 1867, when the chapel was swept by fire, and many have since been only partially restored. Thus, in several instances, the surviving terracotta sketches offer a more complete record of the artists original intentions than the marbles themselves.

Though celebrated today as one of the earliest and most creative of the Impressionists, the landscapist Sisley enjoyed no such recognition during his lifetime. From the early 1870s, when he began to paint professionally, until his death in 1899, he practiced his art in poverty and obscurity, struggling in vain against a hostile public and indifferent press. A Parisian by birth, Sisley entered the atelier of Charles Gleyre (no. 100) in 1862 and there befriended fellow students Claude Monet, Fr√©d√©ric Bazille and Renoir (no. 113). Within months the four young artists had departed from Gleyres studio for Chailly-en-Bi√®re and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There, through their communal experiments with _plein-air_ painting, they sowed the first seeds of Impressionism, and by 1870 Sisleys landscapes had begun to exhibit the clear, high-keyed tones and sketchy, broken color touches of the new style. Though his later landscapes displayed the formal disintegrations inherent in the Impressionist technique, Sisley remained committed to an art of compositional and spatial clarity, to architectonically structured landscapes and carefully calibrated perspectives. Sisley spent most of his life working in the villages and countryside around Paris. Initially he lived in or near Louveciennes (1871-74), Marly-le-Roi (1875-77) and S√®vres (1877-79) and showed a special interest in river and snow scenes. In later years (1880-99) he resided near Fontainebleau in the hamlets of Veneux-Nadon and neighboring Moret, at the juncture of the Seine and Loing rivers, where he repeatedly painted the banks of these waterways and the adjacent fields. Produced at the onset of his final Moret period, _Apple Trees in Flower_ of 1880 portrays the crisp, breezy weather of early spring, when the chill of winter still lingers on the land. Its forms merely summarized by Sisleys dappling, Impressionist brush, the landscape is brought into structural focus through the anchoring verticals of the blossoming fruit trees. The receding lines of the trees also create a sense of deep space, a characteristic feature of Sisleys art. Sisley relished the challenge of capturing the transitory effects of light and weather and the fleeting magic of seasonal change. In an enthusiastic letter written from Moret in the spring of 1883, he reported: The weather has been wonderful. I have started work again, but unfortunately, because it has been such a dry spring, the fruit trees are not flowering all at once, and the blossoms are dropping very quickly. And I am trying to paint them! Jefferson C. Harrison. _The Chrysler Museum Handbook of the European and American Collections: Selected Paintings, Sculpture and Drawings_.

Fromentin possessed remarkably varied artistic talents. He achieved fame not only as a painter, but as a travel writer, novelist, and art critic. After devoting his youth to the study of law, he resolved to become an artist and in 1844 began his training in Paris with the landscape painter Louis Cabat. A fleeting visit to Algeria in 1846 confirmed his growing interest in romantic, Orientalist themes (see nos. 76, 99). When two of his North African pictures were applauded at the 1847 Salon in Paris - his public debut - he returned to Algeria for a longer stay. By 1850 Fromentin was well-known in France as a leading Orientalist painter, and his final Algerian sojourn of 1852-53 provided enough material to sustain him in this genre for the rest of his life. Fromentins passionate interest in North Africa inspired him to write two travel accounts, _A Summer in the Sahara_ and _A Year in the Sahel_, in the later 1850s. In 1862 his famous novel _Dominique_ appeared in print, and just before his untimely death at age fifty-five, he issued his treatise on Dutch and Flemish painting, _Les Ma√Ætres dautrefois_, which is viewed today as one of the most significant pieces of art criticism produced in the nineteenth century. Displayed at the 1863 Salon, The Chrysler Museum painting captures one of Fromentins favorite and most picturesque subjects - the nomadic Arab plainsman astride his coursing steed. Here a falconer on the hunt races before his comrades, clutching in his upraised hand a perch and the leather leashes holding his birds of prey. Fromentins Salon offerings elicited almost unanimously positive reactions from conservative critics and the public, and the _Arab Falconers_ was especially well received. The critic Paul Mantz, for example, marveled at the spirited conception of the horseman, who seemed bewitched by the seductions of the chase. The figure...is full of movement and wild energy. Others praised the artists fluid handling of the brush, which bathes the paintings surface in veils of liquid color. Many European artists of the day viewed the Arab plainsman as an uncorrupted child of Nature, a heroic Noble Savage whose life was still intimately tied to the rhythms and pulse of nature. Fromentin endorses this romanticized view in the _Arab Falconer_, in which the hunter seems as fierce and wild as his mount and birds of prey. The great popularity of the painting encouraged Fromentin to repeat its composition, in mirror image, one year later in a picture now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A closely related watercolor, possibly a study for the _Arab Falconer_, is in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Jefferson C.

In the decades following Napoleons Egyptian campaign of 1798-99, the mysteries of the Islamic East were gradually revealed to a fascinated public in France. Questing for novel and exotic experiences, many Romantic artists began to journey to Morocco, Egypt and the Holy Land. There they discovered new subjects for genre paintings in the Oriental cultures of North Africa and the Near East (see also nos. 88, 99).

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.517 Millet was the leader of the Barbizon School, the group of French landscape and genre painters who abandoned Paris around 1850 to work in the village of Barbizon and the nearby Fontainebleau Forest. There Millet and his Barbizon colleagues produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes -among them, Babys Slumber- that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants. The simplicity and directness of these pictures helped shape the new Realist style that surfaced in French art in the mid-nineteenth century. Babys Slumber depicts the interior of a peasant cottage bathed in soft summer light. In it a young woman busies herself with domestic chores -sewing and mending- while with her foot she rocks her sleeping child in its cradle. Visible through the open window, a man -presumably her husband- works in the garden beyond.

Within a decade he had become a leader of the small, but influential group of landscape and genre painters that had assembled in that tiny village near the Fontainebleu Forest (nos. 72, 77, 86, 103, 112). There, inspired by seventeenth-century Dutch painting and warm recollections of his peasant upbringing in Normandy, Millet produced a revolutionary series of rural genre scenes - among them _Babys Slumber_ of c. 1855 - that celebrated the lives and labors of the French peasants (see also nos. 81, 89). The humble naturalism of these pictures - their naive directness of vision (Robert Herbert) - helped shape the new Realist aesthetic that surfaced in French painting in the mid-nineteenth century. While at Barbizon, Millet instructed a number of younger American painters, who helped to popularize his work in the United States, particularly in Boston. Among them was the Boston artist Edward Wheelwright, who came to Barbizon to study with Millet in October, 1855. Wheelwright stayed on until the following spring and published his recollections in 1876 in the _Atlantic Monthly_; one of the noteworthy events he recounted was his viewing of _Babys Slumber_. Not long after Millet had finished the picture, Wheelwright and several other painters visited his studio while he was away in Paris on business. Inspecting his canvases one by one, they happened upon the painting: At last was brought out from its hiding place a picture representing the interior of a peasants cottage. A young mother was seated, knitting or sewing, while with one foot she rocked the cradle in which lay a child asleep....Anything more exquisitely beautiful than this sleeping child has rarely, I believe, been painted. Through the open window the eye looked out into a garden where a man with his back turned appeared to be at work. The whole scene gave the impression of a hot summers day; you could almost see the trembling motion of the heated air outside, you could almost smell the languid scent of flowers, you could almost hear the droning of the bees, and you could positively feel the absolute quiet and repose, the solemn silence, that pervaded the picture. All those at least felt it who saw the picture upon that...morning. A sudden hush fell upon all the noisy and merry party....The silence that was in some way painted into the canvas seemed to distill from it into the surrounding air. To give depth and resonance to his genre images, Millet frequently alluded to biblical or classical themes. _Babys Slumber_ suggests the domestic harmony of the Holy Family, a parallel that lends an air to sacredness to this modest peasant scene.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.650 Reference: Yale, 1987-88, no. 11. The iridescent color schemes and illusionistic designs of late Baroque decoration were first championed in Naples by Luca Giordano. He was the unrivaled leader of the Neapolitan school of painting during the second half of the seventeenth century and one of the most influential of contemporary European artists. His extraordinary speed and productivity as a painter were legendary. Colleagues called him the Thunderbolt and _Luca fa presto_. Equally dazzling was his capacity to imitate the works of other artists. His boundless talent for creative mimicry was first honed by his father Antonio, a Neapolitan painter and copyist, and in time it earned him the nickname Proteus. For Giordano, the decades after 1650 were marked by almost constant travel - to Florence, Venice, Rome and eventually to Spain. Already by 1660 he had abandoned the dark, Caravaggesque style of Jusepe de Ribera, quite possibly one of his teachers, for a lighter, more colorful late Baroque manner derived from Pietro da Cortonas Roman works and those of the great sixteenth-century Venetians. The Chrysler Museum painting is one of at least three pictures by Giordano (Museo del Castelvecchio, Verona; Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden) that illustrate the mythology of Bacchus and Ariadne. A fluent work of full maturity, it has been dated to Giordanos Florentine sojourn of 1685-86. The dating is based on its strong stylistic kinship to the artists contemporary frescos in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, and particularly to the Medici-Riccardi _Triumph of Bacchus_. As recounted in Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (8:170-182) and other classical sources, Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, helped her beloved Theseus escape the Labyrinth and then sailed with him to the island of Naxos, where he deserted her. Heartbroken at her abandonment, she was discovered on the shore by Bacchus, god of wine, who fell in love with her and, after his voyage to India, returned to marry her. He then placed her marriage crown in the heavens, where it was transformed into a constellation, the corona borealis. In Giordanos painting a love-smitten Bacchus and his celebrants -- maenads, satyrs, putti -- encounter Ariadne for the first time, stealing up on her as she slumbers sadly at waters edge. Ariadnes future betrothal is forecast in the crown of stars that hovers above her.

His paintings brought him considerable success-King Louis XV himself became a patron and offered the artist a royal pension-and they attracted the support of the great Parisian intellectual Denis Diderot, who praised Chardin for the truthfulness and humble poetry of his art.

In the art academies of eighteenth-century Europe, painters of historical and religious themes (see nos. 47, 52) were valued far more highly than those who devoted themselves to the minor subjects of genre, landscape, and still life. Yet, the most inspired interpreters of the minor subjects could achieve considerable fame in their lifetimes and genuine immortality in the annals of art history. One such genius was Chardin, who was among the most revered painters of still life and genre in mid-eighteenth-century Paris. Championed particularly by the influential philosopher and art critic Denis Diderot (d. 1784), Chardin enjoyed both official and popular success. He was an honored member of the Acad√©mie Royale and a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon, and his paintings were avidly collected by a newly affluent French middle class. In his later still lifes, Chardin abandoned his earlier interest in the meticulous delineation of texture and detail and concentrated on more profound visual elements. Color and volume, half-light and highlight, the broad compositional interplay of solid and void - these became the underlying concerns of his mature still lifes such as the _Basket of Plums_. When the painting - or its replica, which is located today in a private French collection - was shown by Chardin at the 1765 Salon, Diderot described it briefly in his commentaries on the exhibition: ...placed on a stone bench, a wicker basket full of plus, for which a paltry string serves as a handle, and scattered around it some walnuts, two or three cherries and a few small bunches of grapes [in truth, white currants]. Though the arrangement is typically spare, the effect on the eye is magical. The luscious mound of purple and rosy red plums smolders in the shadowy light. The currants gleam like pearls. What emerges from this humble assembly of fruits and nuts, and from the velvety brushwork that informs it, is a vision of the poetic essence of objects that dazzled Chardins contemporaries and captivates us perhaps even more today.

Thick brushstrokes define the mans robust, exaggerated physique, but become even less distinct in the background. Bather and Rocks is a fragment of a much larger landscape mural (see illustration). At the time he painted it, C√©zanne was living in an eighteenth-century mansion, Jas de Bouffan, an estate recently purchased by his father on the outskirts of Aix-en-Provence in southern France. The artist covered a wall of its grand salon with an outdoor scene that included this single figure in the foreground. In 1907, the year following C√©zannes death, the portion of the mural containing the nude was detached from the plaster wall, transferred to canvas, and sold. The painting represents C√©zannes first important essay on the bathing nude, an image that would occupy him for the rest of his career.","Provenance":"The artist, Jan de Bouffan (near Aix-en-Provence), ca. 1864/68-1899; Louis Granel, Jas de Bouffan, 1899-1907; Josse Hessel, Paris, 1907; Georges Bernheim, Paris; Alphonse Kahn, Saint-Germain-en-Laye; Paul Rosenberg and Co., New York, by 1952; Walter P.

A major influence on early twentieth-century modernism, C√©zanne labored to restore structure and intellectual control to painting following the era of Impressionism. I want to make of Impressionism something solid, he once proclaimed, like the art of the Museums. In his mature paintings of the 1880s and 1890s, and particularly in his later landscapes and still lifes, C√©zanne portrayed the visible world as an architectonic interlocking of colors and simple, reductive forms, a tight and permanent semiabstraction that would in time inspire the Cubism of Picasso and Braque (no. 139). C√©zannes mature, Post-Impressionist style began to emerge after 1872, when his encounters with Camille Pissarro (no. 96) rapidly transformed his art. Before that time, the young painter had worked in an altogether different style, a blunt and brooding Romantic mode full of dark energy and often violent emotion. This early style, which scholars have only recently begun to research in depth, is revealed to spectacular effect in _Bather and Rocks_ of c. 1860-66. C√©zanne initially divided his time between his native Provence and Paris, where his paintings were consistently refused by the Salon and ridiculed by the critics at the Impressionist exhibits of 1874, 1876 and 1877. After 1877 he secluded himself more and more in Provence - at LEstaque and in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence - and there lived the life of a misanthropic recluse. He often worked in these years at the Jas de Bouffan, his familys country estate on the outskirts of Aix. C√©zannes father, a hard-nosed banker who had little patience for his sons artistic aspirations, purchased the seventeenth-century mansion of the Jas de Bouffan in 1859. Soon after, he reluctantly agreed to let C√©zanne have a studio there. During the following decade he also allowed his son to decorate the grand salon of the Jas de Bouffan with murals of his own design. These large-scale paintings, which C√©zanne executed in oil directly on the plaster walls of the room, are among the most ambitious of his early works. They included two large landscape murals, painted in 1860-62. Probably after his visit to Paris in 1862-64, C√©zanne added the figure of a massively-muscled male nude seen from behind to one of these landscapes - a rocky vista with pine trees and a rushing stream. This _Landscape with Bather_ remained _in situ_ and intact until 1907, the year after C√©zannes death. At that time Louis Granel, who had purchased the house from the artist in 1899, had most of the murals detached from the walls, transferred to canvas and readied for sale. The only portion of the _Landscape with Bather_ that was removed from the wall (and saved from destruction) was the nude male figure - i.e., the _Bather and Rocks_ that is today in The Chrysler Museum. The design and dorsal presentation of C√©zannes nude were clearly influenced by Gustave Courbet, as can be seen, for example, from Courbets 1853 painting of _The Bathers_ in the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier. However, the style of C√©zannes figure - its turbulent brush technique and heavy, black contours - more closely recalls the passionate Romantic art of Delacroix (no. 76). Jefferson C.

Born in Honfleur, the landscape and marine painter Boudin was the son of a Norman ships captain. In his mature pictures he repeatedly portrayed the grand sweep of sea and sky along the French Atlantic coast. Though his first years as a painter were not easy, Boudin remained true to his brisk _plein-air_ technique, and in 1858, at Rouelles in Normandy, he began to teach the young Claude Monet how to paint out-of-doors. The budding Impressionist was soon entranced by the directness of Boudins approach and by his ability to capture the ever-changing qualities of natures light and atmosphere. If I have become a painter, Monet later said, I owe it to Eug√®ne Boudin. Boudins role as mentor to Monet - a role later assumed by Johan Jongkind (no. 95) - confirmed his position as one of Frances most important Pre-Impressionist painters. Boudin received his first recognition in the mid-1860s with his now-famous Trouville and Deauville beach scenes. Executed _en plein air_ with a revolutionary fluidity and dash, these small paintings of fashionable Second-Empire vacationers at seaside were applauded at the Salon in Paris and laid the groundwork for his subsequent success. In later productions like _Beached Boats at Berck_ - an unusually large landscape for Boudin - the artist somewhat tempered his early style with a more deliberate, descriptive realism. The site depicted in the painting is the shore at Berck-sur-Mer, a small village along the English Channel between Dieppe and Calais. Boudin had already visited Berck in 1874, five years before he produced the picture. In the painting, Norman fishermen rest in the humid haze of a summer afternoon, their boats temporarily beached by the receding tide. Some of the fishermen repair their craft, while others take their midday meal. The vast canopy of cloud-filled sky is masterfully portrayed, confirming Corots salute to Boudin as the king of skies. The Impressionists were fascinated by Boudins ability to evoke specific kinds of weather and times of day. So, too, were the critics. One can guess the very season, the time of day, and the wind in Boudins work, marveled Charles Baudelaire in his account of the 1859 Salon. Jefferson C.

Independent and strong-willed, Bonheur ignored the limitations placed on academic training for women and instead taught herself art. She made life studies of farm animals-horses, bull, cows-and copied earlier animal paintings found in the Louvre. She studied animal anatomy in the citys slaughter-houses and even dissected animals at the National Veterinary Institute. Her efforts bore fruit in 1855, when her monumental Horse Fair (see illustration) brought her international acclaim. Like Harriet Hosmer in Rome, Bonheur cut an eccentric figure in Paris, favoring female companions, mens clothes, and cigarettes. When challenged on her unconventional wardrobe, she merely claimed it simplified her field work with animals: I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my sex was a constant bother. This is why I solicited the authorization to wear mens clothing from the prefect of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire, and nothing else.

Among the most poignant of these is his Head of a Boy, which the artist made while perfecting his design for the angel who cradles Victorias deceased grandchildren in his arms. The young son of Dalous London assistant, Angelino Cartioni served as his model. Though Dalou worked to build his reputation in Paris, his career first blossomed in London, where he fled for a time to escape the political reprisals that befell other radical supporters of the Paris Commune at the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871).

The Bust of the Savior was his last work, carved by his own hand at the age of eighty in spiritual preparation for his imminent death. He willed it to his friend and patron, Christina, Queen of Sweden, Romes preeminent Catholic convert. Bernini created a majestic Christ, his head turned heavenward to intercede between God and humankind: the Salvador Mundi (Savior of the World) raises his right hand in eternal blessing. The gesture also alludes to Christs metamorphosis from mortal to divine being. After Christs resurrection and before his ascension into heaven he took care that his body remain undefiled. Noli Me Tangere, he commanded, with his right hand raised. Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). Bernini designed an elaborate seven-foot-high pedestal to support the sculptures base. Viewed from below and at a distance, Christs elongated and exaggerated features would have appeared slightly foreshortened and softened. Sculpted kneeling angels were to support the marble Christ.

Bernini was the greatest sculptor and architect of the seventeenth century and the major founder of Italian High Baroque style. An artistic demigod who dominated the Roman art world for more than fifty years, he was courted by kings and popes throughout his career. At the time of his death - he succumbed to a stroke in Rome in 1680 - he was revered throughout Europe. Bernini began the marble _Bust of the Savior_ in 1679, only a year before his death. Both of his early biographers, Filippo Baldinucci (1682) and Berninis son Domenico (1713), discuss the work at length. They record that the artist intended to present the bust - his final work - as a gift to his dear friend and ardent supporter, Queen Christina of Sweden, who was then living in Rome. Baldinucci writes: Bernini was already in the eightieth year of his life. For some time past he had been turning his most intense thoughts to attaining eternal repose rather than to increasing his earthly glory. Also, deep within his heart was the desire to offer, before closing his eyes to this life, some sign of gratitude to Her Majesty the Queen of Sweden, his most special patron. In order, therefore, to penetrate more deeply into the first concept and to prepare himself better for the second, he set to work with the greatest intensity to create in marble a half -length figure, larger than life-size, of Our Savior Jesus Christ. This is the work that he said was his favorite and it was the last given to the world by his hand. According to Baldinucci, Christina refused the gift in a moment of royal self-deprecation: The Queens opinion of, and esteem for, the statue was so great that, not finding herself in circumstances in which it was possible to give a comparable gift in exchange, she chose to reject it rather than fail in the slightest degree to equal the royal magnificence of her intention. Bernini then bequeathed the bust to her, and, at Christinas death in 1689, it passed to Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi, in whose family it remained at least until 1713, when it was mentioned in an inventory of the Palazzo Odescalchi. By then the sculpture had achieved considerable fame, having been chosen as the official emblem of the Apostolic Hospital in Rome. An early description of the bust states that it originally stood atop an elaborate and richly ornamented pedestal that rose more than seven feet from the floor. Constructed from Berninis own design, the pedestal was composed of a gilded wooden socle, stepped at the top, that supported a pair of kneeling angels, also in gilded wood. The angels, in turn, upheld the bust on a base of Sicilian jasper. As Irving Lavin noted in 1972, Berninis _Savior_ is the first monumental marble bust since antiquity that... [was designed to]...stand free on a pedestal and include both arms. [The figures left hand is tucked beneath the right, its wrist just visible.] It combines, in an unprecedented way for a Christian image, the living and dramatic quality of a narrative figure with the commemorative and idolous quality of a classical bust monument. Turning his head heavenward and raising his right hand in blessing, Berninis Christ proclaims his role as intercessor between God and man, his divine mission as _Salvator Mundi_. Though universal in its spiritual message, the bust remains an intensely personal creation, Berninis very private tribute to the deity on the eye of his own demise. It is Berninis last will and testament as an artist, an embodiment of his faith and hope for salvation. Among the artists preliminary drawings for the _Bust of the Savior_ are a black chalk study of the angels that once supported the bust (Museum der bildenden K√ºnste, Leipzig) and a sheet of black chalk studies of the Saviors head and chest (Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, Rome). A marble copy of the bust, made by an unknown artist at the time of Berninis death, is preserved in the Cathedral at S√©es in France." },

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

With its broadly modeled figures and bright colors flatly applied, the schematic design of the painting here typifies the Cranach shop style-a style intended to convey narrative as simply and directly as possible. As told in John 8:2-11, the Pharisees, hoping to trap Jesus in an intellectual double bind, confronted him with an adulterous woman and demanded she be killed for her crime as dictated by the law of Moses. Jesus deflected their challenge by answering, Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone. (That text, in German, is inscribed along the paintings upper edge.) Filled with shame, the defeated Pharisees dispersed. Cranach depicts the storys climax: As the Pharisees clamor for an answer, Christ points compassionately at the adulteress and forgives her sin. Luther himself preached on the theme of Christ and the adulteress, reminding his listeners that any sinner, if repentant, could be forgiven in the kingdom of Christ.","Provenance":"Wesendonck auction, Cologne (Lempertz), Nov. 27, 1935, lot 24, on loan to Bonn, Provinzialmuseum (cat. 1927, nr. 50); Wesendonck collection, Hamburg, Germany; Gsell collection, Vienna, Austria; Schonemon Galleries, NYC; Walter P.

Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at far left, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman. While in contrast, the more finely worked and opulent House of Simon reveals the delicacy of the emerging rococo.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric.

The painting was originally paired with a pendant image of the Virgin Mary in her role as Mater Dolorosa, the sorrowing Mother of Christ. Immensely popular among the Catholic faithful, such modest devotional diptychs (two-part altarpieces) stressed the accessibility and human nature of the Madonna and her suffering Son and were generally intended for private meditation and prayer. The figure is set against a gold ground-an eternal, spiritualized backdrop that underscores the figure as a holy icon abstracted from a specific time or place. The emphasis on Christs suffering-his open wounds and tear-streaked face-is picked up even in the gold ground, which is dotted with hundreds of tiny touches of blood-red paint. Aelbrecht was trained by his famous father, Dieric Bouts, one of the last great painters of the fifteenth-century Flemish Renaissance. In paintings like this one, he carried his fathers style well into the sixteenth century.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

In the painting, Martha turns in complaint toward Christ, her worldly concerns reflected in her large, well-stocked kitchen.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.639 Each of De Troys companion paintings illustrates a biblical scene in which Christ blesses an outcast woman and, in so doing, demonstrates his compassion for the downtrodden, yet faithful victim. Christ in the House of Simon (Luke 7:36-50) depicts a sinful woman kneeling in repentance before Christ. She washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair, covering them in ointment from an alabaster jar. While Simon, pictured in a turban, questions the propriety of the womans actions, Christ praises her for her love and pardons her sins. In the thematically related Christ and the Canaanite Woman at right, a mother begs Christ to banish the devil from her stricken daughter (Matthew 15:22-28). Christ observes that because the woman is not a Jew he cannot take the children of Israels bread and cast it to dogs. Turning his metaphor to her own advantage, the woman responds: Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters plate. (The dog in the painting alludes to their exchange.) Over the objection of his disciples, Christ blesses the woman and miraculously heals her daughter. Created in the same year, the two paintings demonstrate a blending of styles that deftly coexist in De Troys mature art. The vibrant Baroque language of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens is reflected in the broad handling and stark monumentality of The Canaanite Woman. While in contrast, the more finely worked and opulent House of Simon reveals the delicacy of the emerging rococo.

After further study in Rome (1699-1706), he returned to Paris and was admitted to the Acad√©mie as a history painter. A prolific artist who embraced a wide range of themes, De Troy excelled at portraiture and grandiose decorative cycles of mythological and religious content. He was also famous for his tapestry designs and his small-scale genre pictures of aristocratic dalliance, his elegant _tableaux de modes_. In all of these works De Troy employed a charming, yet vigorous style that blended the delicacy of the emerging rococo with the more vibrant Baroque language of Rubens and Jacob Jordaens. By the mid-1730s De Troy had won the patronage of Louis XV and had collaborated with Fran√ßois Boucher (no. 51) and Charles Natoire at Versailles. However, his fondest wish - to become _premier peintre du Roi_ (first painter to the king) - was denied him in 1736, when his old rival Fran√ßois Le Moyne was chosen for the post. In 1738 De Troy returned to Rome, where he served as director of the French Academy until 1751. Painted in Rome in 1743, the ambitious biblical pendants in The Chrysler Museum typify the dramatic, grand manner of De Troys second Italian period, the weighty, classic figure style that he distilled from Jordaens, Jean Jouvenet and the Neapolitan Baroque. In both pictures - _Christ and the Canaanite Woman_ (Matthew 15:22-28) and _Christ in the House of Simon_ (Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-8) - Jesus blesses an outcast woman, demonstrating his compassion for the downtrodden victim who has, despite everything, remained faithful. The broad handling and stark monumentality of _The Canaanite Woman_ contrast with the more finely worked and opulent _House of Simon_, where the figures all but vanish beneath billowing waves of brilliant-hued fabric.

Chrysler, Jr., 83.586 Reference: Sokolowski, _CM_, 1983, pp. 12-13. Auctioned in London in 1973 from the English parish of All-Hallows-Berkyngechirche-by-the-Tower, this panel is one of the most handsome early Netherlandish paintings to have come to light in recent years. The style of the painting - its meticulous realism and sense of calm, the noble stasis and solidity of its forms which are modeled softly in light - has been attributed to Gerard David, the last of the great fifteenth century artists. Trained quite probably in Haarlem in the northern Netherlands, David moved south to more cosmopolitan Bruges by 1484, the year he joined that citys painters guild. His eclectic, revivalist style, which took much from Jan van Eyck and the other great founders of the Flemish _ars mova_, quickly found favor in Bruges, and after Hans Memlings death in 1494, David became the citys leading painter. In 1501 he was made dean of the Bruges painters guild. _Christ on the Cross between Saints John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi_ has been dated around 1484-92, at the outset of Davids career in Bruges. As Diane Scillia has noted, the figure of Christ -- ultimately Eyckian in inspiration -- follows the design of the crucified Savior in Davids roughly contemporary _Calvary_ painting in Lugano (Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection), while the characterization of Saint John the Baptist recalls the same figure in Memlings _Altarpiece of John Donne_ of ca. 1480 in the National Gallery, London. The painting is not an illustration of the historic movement of the Crucifixion, but a meditative image of Christ on the Cross that transcends time and place. It is a symbol of Christs sacrifice and the promise of salvation that he offers. At left, John the Baptist preaches the advent of Christ: one mightier than I cometh (Luke 3:16). At right, Francis of Assisi (d. 1226), founder of the Franciscan order, displays the stigmata, which symbolize the transforming power of the Christian faith. The message of divine promise -- and of promise fulfilled -- receives triumphant, if delicately understated, expression in the tiny window of the building in the background at left. There the newly risen Christ, victorious over death, appears before the Virgin. The presence of John the Baptist and Francis of Assisi suggests that the work was intended for a chapel dedicated to the veneration of those saints. The distant cityscape -- similar to that in the background of Davids _Nativity_in Budapest (Museum of Fine Arts) and quite possibly a depiction of an actual Flemish town -- may well include the monastery or castle for which the picture was made.

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.479 Painted by the artist toward the end of his career, the 1565 CONCERT OF APOLLO AND THE MUSES ON MOUNT HELICON confirms Heemskercks enduring devotion to mythological subjects in the Italian mode. Already in ancient Greek literature of the eighth century B.C. -- and particularly in Hesiods Theogony -- Greeces Mount Helicon was identified as the sacred abode of the nine goddesses of poetry and song, the Muses. There, joined sometimes by Apollo -- the god of music -- the Muses danced, sang and inspired mortal singers and poets with their music and sprigs of laurel. Mentioned, too, as a source of poetic inspriation were the waters of Helicons fountain of Hippocrene, which according to Ovid, gushed forth from the hoofmarks of the winged horse Pegasus. Heemskerck envisions Helicon as an idyllic, tree-shaded paradise, an antique pleasure garden set with statues and littered with books and musical instruments. He alludes to the creation of Hippocrene in an ingenious way, portraying Pegasus as a monumental bronze statue and the fountain as a spray of water issuing from its strut. The two male figures standing at right are poets who have received inspiration and been crowned with laurel. Other mortal pilgrims promenade, pick flowers or bathe in Hippocrenes inspiring waters, while above them putti hover, waiting to bestow more crowns of laurel. With an informality typical of the age, Heemskerck chooses not to identify the Muses by their traditional attributes. So casual is his approach that it is difficult even to locate all nine of the goddesses. Four of them have gathered to sing and make music at the positive organ at left, its bellows worked by a mischievous putto. A pair are seated at right, and two more join Apollo -- kneeling, with his lyre in hand -- in the central middleground. The remaining Muse has merged with the crowd of pilgrims beyond. A recent study of the paintings underdrawing using infrared reflectography has revealed an interesting detail: Heemskerck initially sketched two bearded, male heads at the extreme left of the composition, where he later chose to paint the standing nude Muse. The High Renaissance image of Apollo and the Muses was perfected in early sixteenth-century Italy, where Raphaels Vatican PARNASSUS fresco of 1510-11 was profoundly influential. By the 1540s, French and Flemish artists had also begun to interpret the subject. Among contemporary north Netherlandish painters, Heemskerck seems to have been the principal champion of the theme. In 1549 he designed an etching of APOLLO AND THE MUSES and around 1555 returned to the subject in a painting today in the New Orleans Museum of Art. The Chrysler Museum painting is Heemskercks final and most developed vision of Apollo and the Muses. It is also one of the richest representations of the theme in sixteenth-century art. [Jefferson C.

Chief among the sixteenth-century Netherlandish proponenets of Italian style (cf. nos 9, 15) was the Haarlem painter Maerten van Heemskerck. Between 1532 and 1537 he visited Rome, where he made drawings of antique sculpture and architecture and was affected by the late Mannerist aesthetic of the painters Francisco Salviati and Jacopino del Conte. He returned to Haarlem a convert to Italian art and by mid-century had become the most prominent of Italianate painters working in the northern Netherlands. Heemskerck produced mostly relgious images - altarpieces and devotional panels for the Catholic churches of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft. But he also created a remarkable number of mythological and allegorical paintings that revealed his interest in humanistic themes. Painted by the artist towards the end of his career, the 1565 _Concert of Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helicon_ confirms Heemskercks enduring devotion to mythological subjects in the Italian mode.

There, joined sometimes by Apollo - the god of music- the Muses danced, sang and inspired mortal singers and poets with their music and sprigs of laurel. Mentioned, too, as a source of poetic inspiration were the waters of Helicons fountain of Hippocrene, which, according to Ovid, gushed forth from the hoofmarks of the winged horse Pegasus. Heemskerck envisions Helicon as an idyllic, tree-shaded paradise, an antique pleasure garden set with statues and littered with books and musical instruments. he alludes to the creation of Hippocrene in an ingenious way, portraying Pegauss as a monumental bronze statue and the fountain as a spray of water issuing from its strut. The two male figures standing at right are poets who have received inspiration and been crowned with laurel. Other mortal pilgrims promenade, pick flowers or bathe in Hippocrenes inspiring waters, while above them putti hover, waiting to bestow more crowns of laurel. With an informality typical of the age, Heemskerck chooses not to identify the Muses by their traditional attributes. So casual is his approach that it is difficult even to locate all nine of the goddesses. Four of them have gathered to sing and make music at the postitive organ at left, its bellows worked by a mischevious putto. A pair are seated at right, and two more join Apollo - kneeling, with his lyre in hand - in the central middleground. The remaining Muse has merged with the crowd of pilgrims beyond. A recent study of the paintings underdrawing using infared reflectography has revealed an interesting detail: Heemskerck initially sketched two bearded, male heads at the extreme left of the composition where he later chose to paint the standing nude Muse. The High Renaissance image of Apollo and the Muses was perfected in early sixteenth-century Italy, where Raphaels Vatican _Parnassus_ fresco of 1510-11 was profoundly influential. by the 1540s, French and Flemish artists had also begun to interpret the subject. Among contemporary north Netherlandish painters, Heemskerck seems to have been the principal champion of the theme. In 1549 he designed an etching of _Apollo and the Muses_ and around 1555 returned to the subject in a painting today in the New Orleans Museum of Art. The Chrysler Museum painting is Heemskercks final and most developed vision of Apollo and the Muses. It is also one of the richest representations of the theme in sixteenth-century art. Jefferson C.

Chrysler, Jr. 89.57 Reference: Albert Ch√¢telet, _Early Dutch Painting: Painting in the Northern Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century_, New York, 1981: 233-234, no. 127-A. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the scholar Max J. Friedl√§nder identified a stylistically similar group of paintings and woodcuts that he credited to an unknown late-fifteenth-century Netherlandish artist. He called the painter the Master of the _Virgo inter Virgines_, a pseudonym he derived from one of the artists most famous pictures, the _Virgo inter Virgines_, or _Madonna and Child with Female Saints_, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Since the Masters woodcuts appear in books published in Delft between 1483 and 1498, it is generally assumed that he practiced in that city during the final quarter of the fifteenth century. Scholars have sometimes attempted to identify him with either of two documented Delft painters of the period- Pieter die Maelre or Dirc Jansz- but these identifications remain hypothetical. In his later works the Master devised an eccentric, expressive late Gothic style that recalls the paintings of his contemporaries, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These highly emotional, angst-ridden works are often marked by violently animated figures and unsettling anecdotal details. Even in his somewhat quieter and more austere early works, like the _Crucifixion_ of c. 1480, the Masters expressionism is already apparent in the pungent characterization of his doll-like figures - in the sharply linear rendering of their gaunt, bony forms and disquieting facial features, in the agitated calligraphy of their densely folded draperies. The style and dimensions of the _Crucifixion_ correspond almost exactly to two other panels by the Master, a _Lamentation_ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a _Resurrection_ in Amsterdams Rijksmuseum. It is often suggested that all three panels originally belonged to the same altarpiece, a small Passion polyptych. In this, scholars speculate, the _Crucifixion_ and _Lamentation_ would have functioned together as the centerpiece and the _Resurrection_ as the right shutter. The panel that is presumed to have served as the left shutter has yet to be discovered. In the _Crucifixion_ the weeping holy woman at the far left brings to mind particularly the female figures in the paintings of the Masters Flemish contemporary, Petrus Christus. The armor-clad man at lower right, prayerfully attending the crucified Christ with a hand raised to his heart, seems to have been depicted in a more individualized manner than his neighbors and may portray the paintings donor.

As an artist, he thrived on recording the many gestures and poses of its sinewy ballet dancers, whether adored and elegant in a performance, hard at work in rehearsal, or depleted and anonymous backstage. These often-unglamorous images appear in his paintings, pastels, prints, and sculpture, and constitute at least half of his mature work. In Dancer with Bouquets a prima ballerina stands before a painted backdrop and curtsies to her audience. She raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd. At her feet rest bouquets tossed by her admirers. A harsh glare from the footlights illuminates her figure, revealing her rather inelegant profile and giving the painting a sense of frank immediacy. The same stage lighting gives her diaphanous skirt a gauzy, indistinct appearance so favored by the Impressionists. The heavy lines used to indicate the dancers limbs became more common in Degas work as his eyesight began to fail. Pentimenti-areas of the composition subsequently altered and painted over, yet visible today-can be seen along the contours of the dancers face and arms, indicating that Degas reworked the figure considerably.","Provenance":"The artist, ca. 1895-1917; the artists family, 1917-1918; Degas sale, Georges Petit, Paris, May 4, 1918; J.

Edgar Degas was most widely known in his lifetime, and is beloved today particularly, as a painter of the dance. Already in 1867, in his _Mlle Fiocre in the Ballet from La Source_ (Brooklyn Museum), he had begun to interpret subjects drawn from the ballet of the Paris Op√©ra. He continued to do so - in hundreds of paintings, sculptures, pastels and prints - for the next forty years. In the nineteenth century the ballet was one of the prime cultural diversions of the Parisian upper class. Degas fascination may have been fostered at an early age by his father, a wealthy Paris banker who was deeply interested in music and surely held a subscription, or _abonnement_, to the Op√©ra. Degas chose for his subjects not merely the seasoned stars of the Op√©ra stage, like the dancer portrayed in The Chrysler Museum picture, but the lesser ranks of the _corps de ballet_ and even the adolescent apprentices, the _petits rats_. He showed dancers in performance, at rest or in transit backstage, and at work in the rehearsal hall, moving their often reluctant bodies through endless hours of exercise at the barre. In the discipline of the dance Degas may have sensed a metaphor for his own lifelong quest for aesthetic control. More important to the Impressionist Degas, however; was the opportunity the ballet offered to research the transitory effects of gesture and motion, the dynamics of human movement. _Dancer with Bouquets_ was produced late in Degas career - around 1895-1900, when his eyesight was failing and he had begun to work in broader, more vigorous strokes. In the painting a prima ballerina takes a bow at the end of a performance: at her feet are bouquets of flowers tossed by an adoring audience. Standing before a painted landscape backdrop, he raises her hand as if to kiss the crowd before her. The footlights, which fill the scene with a magical, if rather harsh, incandescence, transform the gauzy layers of her gown into a smoldering violet-grey cloud. Though painted on a large, official scale - unusual for the late Degas - _Dancer with Bouquets_ was not exhibited during the artists lifetime, but remained in his studio, where it served as a model for other works. The dancers pose was also used in one of Degas later sculptures, _The Bow_ of c. 1896. The _pentimenti_ visible along the contours of the dancers face and arms indicate that Degas reworked her pose considerably. There are at least four preparatory studies for the figure. One, a half-length _√©tude_ in pastel, was included in the second Degas atelier sale in Paris in December of 1918. The remaining three - full-length figure studies in charcoal and pastel and yet another half-length sketch in charcoal - were dispersed in 1919 at the third of the posthumous Degas sales. In _Dancer with Bouquets_ the scene is viewed obliquely, as if from the wings or a private side box. The odd angle of the viewers vantage point and the tricks it plays with perspective and the dancers pose are typical of Degas later, more abstracted compositions. The sharply lighted, unlovely features of the aging dancers face and the sense of motion arrested create and image of nearly photographic frankness and immediacy - an unstudied snapshot of reality stolen from the flow of time.

Chrysler, Jr. 71.716 Drawn from ancient Greek mythology, the pastoral love story of Daphnis and Chlo√´ was a favorite of 19th-century French academic painters. According to the story, the two were thrown together in infancy and nursed by a sheep and cow. They were soon taken in by a shepherd and his wife and spent a carefree childhood together watching over their stepparents flock. They eventually fell in love with each other and married. Vibert depicts the enchanted moment when childhood gives way to the first stirrings of love, as Daphnis teaches Chlo√´ to play the shepherds flute. The event unfolds in an idyllic forest glade carpeted with grass and flowers, an earthly paradise where all is gentleness and innocence. Vibert exhibited the painting in Paris at the 1866 Salon, and though many praised the work, the twenty-six-year-old artist soon abandoned ambitious mythological subjects like Daphnis and Chlo√´ for small-scale scenes of the Catholic clergy. These light-hearted satires of the religious life proved immensely popular, and with them Vibert became one of the best-known artists of the late 19th century.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

According to Ovids _Metamorphoses_ (2:401-465), Diana, the Roman goddess of the chase and protectress of women, required that the nymphs who attended her on her hunts in Arcadia be chaste. One of them, the beautiful Callisto, had the misfortune to catch Jupiters eye while she was hunting alone in the forest. Disguised as Diana, Jupiter came to her and seduced her. Upon her return to Dianas camp, Callisto reluctantly disrobed to bathe along with the other nymphs and was discovered to be pregnant. Enraged at Callistos transgression, Diana drove her away. This dramatic moment of banishment is the subject David Wilkie depicted in his painting of _Diana and Callisto_. A lofty historical subject drawn from classical mythology, the theme of Diana and Callisto was an unusual one for the Scottish-born Wilkie. Moving to London in 1805, he achieved fame there primarily as a portraitist and painter of earthy, humorous genre images like his well-known _Blind Fiddler_ (Tate Gallery, London). But _Diana and Callisto_ was produced at the beginning of Wilkies career, in 1803-04, when the nineteen-year-old artist was still a student at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and had not yet freed himself from the academic interests of his teacher, John Graham. Under Grahams direction, the Academy held a yearly competition among its students for the best history painting. In 1803 the contest subject was Diana and Castillo; Wilkie submitted the present painting and with it won the first prize of nine pounds in early 1804. Wilkie clearly intended to depict the elevated theme of Diana and Callisto in a suitably serious, idealizing style. Nevertheless, there is much in the painting - for example, the powerful and highly individualized facial expressions of Diana and her nymphs - that forecasts the pithy naturalism of the artists mature genre pictures. Writing about _Diana and Callisto_ in 1848, John Burnet remarked that the close observation of nature [in the painting] was apparent, however inappropriate to the higher walks of art....[Callisto] was made to blush with so deep a colour in the ear and upper part of the neck as gave Graham an opportunity...for descanting on the difficulty of introducing the peculiarities of familiar life into the higher branches of art.

Dominique Ingres Eugene Delacroix Bronze Gift of Walter P.

The two were introduced by Renoirs dealer Ambrose Vollard. Vollard suggested that the painter, then seventy-one years old and confined to a wheelchair, create designs which Guino would translate into plaster and Vollard would cast in bronze. Among the fruits of their four-year association (1913-17) was a set of six bronze portrait medallions celebrating those French artists Renoir believed to be the finest of his era: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and Auguste Rodin. Each of the artists had an impact on Renoirs art. The great painter Ingres, for example, had been a beacon for Renoir in the 1880s, when he labored to discipline the improvisational painting technique of Impressionism with a more controlled, classically-ordered approach to the human form. And in the revolutionary color theories of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Renoir saw the intellectual foundation for the brilliant, rainbow palette used by him and his fellow Impressionists.

The vacationers here are not wealthy folk in elegant seaside attire, but ordinary working people enjoying a day off. Like the other French Neo-Impressionists, Henri Edmond Cross was a political leftist who championed the rights of the laboring classes. In paintings like Excursion he created an idealized vision of French society in which labor, the arts, and leisure combined to form a utopian view of modern life. The young Cross arrived in Paris in 1881 and soon befriended the painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, the first practitioners of Neo-Impressionism. Their deliberate dotted painting technique involved the methodical placement of tiny pinpoints of color. In 1892-a year after Seurats death-Cross and Signac settled in Provence, in the South of France. There, inspired by the vibrant light and radiant hues of the Mediterranean coast, Cross produced his most ambitious works in the Neo-Impressionist style, chief among them Excursion.","Provenance":"Cross atelier sale, Hotel Drouot, Oct. 28, 1921 (cat. no. 27); Dr. Roudinesco, Paris; Walter P.

Chrysler, Jr., 77.416 Reference: Isabelle Compin, _H.E. Cross_, Paris, 1964, pp. 135-136, no. 45. Like his colleague Paul Signac (no. 122), Henri Edmond Cross played a key role in the development of Neo-Impressionism following the death of the movements founder, Georges Seurat, in 1891. Born the son of a Douai ironmonger, Cross arrived in Paris by 1881 to conclude his art studies with the painters Emile Dupont-Zipcy and Fran√ßois Bonvin. As an inaugural member of the progressive Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Cross met Seurat and Signac at the founding of that institution in 1884, though he did not fully adopt their dotted painting method - divisionism - for another seven years (see no. 122). By 1892 both Cross and Signac had left Paris and settled in Provence, Cross at Saint-Clair and Signac at nearby Saint-Tropez. Stimulated by the warming radiance and boisterous colors of the Mediterranean coast, they gradually renounced the constraints of Seurats optical theories and densely granulated brush technique. In a series of light-soaked, arcadian landscapes, they evolved a more vibrant divisionist method, painting in progressively broader blocks of brilliant color. Their research was already well advanced by 1895, as seen in Cross imposing _Excursion_ of that year. In time their style would have a profound influence on the art of the young Henri Matisse and his fellow Fauves (nos. 132, 128), who frequently visited Saint-Tropez around 1904 to study with Signac and Cross. One of Cross most complex figurative landscapes, _Excursion_ depicts a carefree group of summer holiday makers as they relax on a windswept bluff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The paintings arcardian mood evokes the eighteenth-century _f√™tes galantes_ of Antoine Watteau. Its decorative surface patterns - its sweeping curves and arabesques - bring to mind the contemporary work of the Nabis. The subdued color scheme of pink, mauve, green and light blue captures perfectly the sun-bleached palette of Provence. Indeed, Cross noted as he worked on the picture that it would require tints compatible with a sunny plain - not too rich, but more neutral and grey in tone. The _Excursion_ was largely finished by December of 1894, when fellow-divisionist Maximilien Luce mentioned it in a letter to Cross: Signac has told me about a painting of yours that he likes very much (the excursionists); from his description it sounds very interesting. While on display in Paris at the 1895 Salon des Ind√©pendants, the work was viewed by Camille Pissarro (no. 96), who referred to it in an April 8 letter to his son Lucien, and by Signac, who recorded his impressions of it in the April 26 entry of his journal. The painting remained with Cross until his death and was sold at the 1921 auction of his atelier. Three preliminary works survive: a pencil sketch for the standing female figure (Cabinet des dessins, Louvre, Paris), a large compositional study in oil (Petit Palais, Mus√©e dArt Moderne, Geneva) and a smaller oil sketch of the landscape (private collection, Paris).

Like his colleague Bouguereau (no. 87), G√©r√¥me was a standard-bearer of the French academic style, a conservative grand master who carried the hallowed traditions of Davidian classicism into the second half of the nineteenth century. Like Bouguereau, too, he was one of the most influential artists of his day. For a full forty years (1863-1904) he served as a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his impeccable professional credentials drew generations of students, many of the Americans, to his atelier. G√©r√¥me achieved his greatest fame as an interpreter of Orientalist subjects (see nos. 76, 88). In the years after 1853 he traveled repeatedly to North Africa and the Near East - he visited Egypt alone seven times - and he devoted more and more of his art to genre images of Arab life. These works offered a more balanced and realistic portrayal of contemporary Egypt and Arabia than had earlier Romantics like Delacroix (no. 76). However, in the clarity and polish of their brushwork - in their careful crafting of detail and draftsmanly precision - G√©r√¥mes Orientalist pictures remained thoroughly academic. G√©r√¥me made his earliest tour of Egypt in 1856. He spent half of his eight-month visit in Cairo and the other half navigating the Nile, sketching the fabled waterway and its exotic river traffic. Thereafter the Nile became a favored setting for his Egyptian genre pieces, as can be seen in the well-known _Excursion of the Harem_ of 1869, in which a delicate private pleasure craft ferries a sultans seraglio along the river. G√©r√¥me exhibited the painting at the Salon of 1869, where it was warmly received. The Empress Eug√©nie, wife of Napoleon III, hoped to buy it but demurred when told its price - 30,000 francs. After viewing the _Excursion_, the critic Th√©ophile Gautier marveled at its atmospheric and luminary subtleties: The boat slips over the clear transparent water, along the misty shore in a sort of luminous fog which produces a magical effect. The bark seems to float at the same time in the water and in the air....the delicate tones of the land of light are rendered by Monsieur G√©r√¥me with absolute fidelity. A recent cleaning of the painting has once again revealed its luminous palette of mauve and violet hues. The work must also have appealed to the young American Thomas Eakins, who studied with G√©r√¥me from 1866 to 1869 and whose Philadelphia sculling pictures of the early 1870s owe an obvious debt to G√©r√¥mes _Excursion_ and other Egyptian river scenes.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.2041A and 71.2041B, respectively Antoine Coysevox was a leading sculptor of Louis XIVs reign and a major interpreter of the Sun Kings Baroque court style. After studying at the Acad√©mie Royale, he was named royal _sculpteur_ in 1666. With the assistance of Louis all-powerful first painter, Charles Le Brun, he was made a professor at the Acad√©mie in 1678. Soon after he joined in the sculptural decoration of Versailles. His subsequent career was one of unbroken ascent. Royal commissions and court requests for portrait busts and statues, for funerary moments and ch√¢teau decorations followed one another in rapid succession, and in 1702 Coysevox was named director of the Acad√©mie. Perhaps the most renowned sculptures of Coysevoxs career were the monumental equestrian marble groups of _Fame_ and _Mercury_ that he produced in 1701-02 for the terrace of the Abreuvoir (horses watering pond) at Louis ch√¢teau at Marly. The pendants, which were moved in 1719 to the Tuileries gardens in Paris, were widely acclaimed. The king rewarded Coysevox with an annual pension of 4000 _livres), the largest yearly stipend he ever granted to an artist in his employ. In the years after 1702 Coysevox and his followers were called upon to issue numerous small replicas in bronze, among them the pair in The Chrysler Museum. Soaring aloft on the winged Pegasus, the female figure of Fame blows upon her horn, while her companion Mercury rides heavenward on his own winged mount. The political import of these allegorical pendants is made clear in the imagery decorating their struts. Each bears a breastplate on which Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, entrusts the female personification of France to Louis XIV. The image underscores Louis absolute power as guardian and ruler of France and his divine right as king. As Pegasus leaps skyward with the trumpeting figure of Fame, it is the kings own ascent to greatness and immortality that is celebrated. As emissary of the gods, Mercury carries the same divinely-sanctioned message heavenward. Jefferson C.

Though that sculpture has not yet been identified, the figures dramatically animated poses and fear-stricken faces - their open mouths shrieking in horror - suggest a violent subject involving falling figures, such as the Fall of the Damned or Fall of the Giants. The figures poses and style bring to mind the marble river gods sculpted by Gianlorenzo Bernini in 1648-51 for his monumental Fountain of the Four Rivers in the Piazza Navona, Rome. In all likelihood, the sculptures here were executed in Rome in the decades around 1700. Intended as sketches for larger works, the two bronzes are nonetheless brilliantly conceived and beautifully finished. Their glowing, gilt surfaces are elaborately chased (textured with chisels) to catch and reflect light. Edited By: GLY","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

By 1850 most of them had abandoned Paris for the village of Barbizon near the Fontainebleau Forest, where they painted the landscape and humble inhabitants of the French countryside. Like many in the group, Dupr√© traveled widely in his search for new subjects. From 1865 he and his family spent the summer months in Cayeux-sur-Mer, a small fishing port on the Channel coast. There he painted a series of seascapes and beach scenes that rank among his finest works. They include this romantic canvas, in which a lone fishing craft is shown stranded at low tide, a melancholic reminder of mans helplessness against the forces of nature.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"Signed.","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA Gift of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. 71.2060 Like his older colleagues Charles Vernet-Lecomte, Charles Chaplin, and L√©on Perrault, Jacquet was a standard bearer of the conservative academic-classical style in late-19th-century Paris. A pupil of the French academic master William Bouguereau, he perfected a tight, enameled painting technique which he brought to bear on a range of traditional subjects-portraits, historical costume pieces, sensual female nudes, and sentimental genre images like Girl Minstrel. Between 1864 and his death in 1909, he exhibited his work regularly at the Paris Salon, and by the 1890s he was one of the citys most esteemed and widely known painters. Yet with the triumph of modernist painting in the early 20th century, his reputation rapidly declined, and by the 1920s he was all but forgotten. One of the loveliest of Jacquets works, Girl Minstrel coyly captures the melancholy predicament of a young waif who must fend for herself in a harsh world. Dressed in rags and rough homespun, she holds a hurdy-gurdy, a musical instrument long associated in European art with gypsies and the lower classes. As with the paintings by Chaplin and Perrault nearby, Jacquets sentimental subject is little more than a pretext for presenting a suggestive image of an attractive and vulnerable young girl in need of rescue.

The top of the door jamb curves rather than meet at a 90 degree angle. The stonework tracery above the door is very thick. The outer portion of a carving begins as a gothic pointed arch; as the carving moves toward the interior, the arch looks like the ogee shape. There are two figures carved into the stone. The man on the left wears tights and a doublet, his hair is straight cut just at ear level. The man on the right wears boots, short pants, a coat and a small round cap. He holds a bag full of something, possibly money. His hair is shoulder length. There was once an image in between the two men, centrally located over the door. It has broken away and there is no indication of what it might have been. The border at the top might be a pattern of oak leaves and acorns, but it is so worn down that an exact idea is not visible.","Height":" 109 1/2  in","Width":" 68 in","Artist":"Unknown","Artist-Nationality":"Unknown","Artist Birth-Year":"0","Artist Death-Year":"0","Object Label":"French, 16th century Gothic Doorway Stone Gift of Charles D. Kelekian 53.48.5 From their grand sculpted portals and glowing stained-glass windows to the intricate patterns of their massive stone floors, Gothic cathedrals, cloisters, and other buildings were replete with decorative embellishment. In some instances decoration took the form of figurative scenes drawn from the Bible, illustrating the age-old Christian themes of sin and salvation. In other cases, as with the column capital at left, decoration was more purely ornamental, meant simply to enliven the architecture and give rein to the artists imagination and sense of play. The two male figures crowning the doorway here are too worn to be clearly identified. The figure at right appears to hold a moneybag, perhaps indicating that the door once served as an entrance to a mercantile exchange, or that it illustrated a subject such as the biblical parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Without the sculptural element that initially served as centerpiece-its form sheered away-we are left to speculate about the doors original intent and location. Yet we can still admire the elaborately carved Gothic tracery and foliate frieze, and the solid, well-formed figures, all of which give presence and even grandeur to this modest portal.","Provenance":"Unknown","Inscriptions":"unknown","Catalog Entry":"unknown" },

Chrysler, Jr. 71.2063 The provenance (collection history) of Chaplins Ha√Ød√©e is typical of the fate of many French academic paintings in the 20th century and says much about the vagaries of artistic fashion. Celebrated in his day for his paintings of beautiful women and the female nude, Chaplin completed Ha√Ød√©e in 1873 and unveiled it that same year at the Paris Salon. The painting, which coyly depicts the heroine of Lord Byrons epic poem Don Juan, was purchased from the artist by Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, an important New York collector of French painting who in 1887 bequeathed her entire collection, including Ha√Ød√©e, to the newly-founded Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met retained Ha√Ød√©e through the first half of the 20th century, a time when the critical opinion of 19th-century French academic art had begun to slide. With the triumph of the Abstract Expressionists and other American avant-garde artist groups in the mid-1950s, traditional academic art seemed permanently discredited. And in 1956 the Met decided to remove Ha√Ød√©e and scores of other 19th-century pictures from its collection. Soon after, Chaplins painting was auctioned in New York and purchased by Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. Chrysler shrewdly sensed an opportunity in this long-neglected area of the art market and during the 1950s had begun to acquire major examples of 19th-century French academic painting at historically low prices. (He paid $325 for Ha√Ød√©e.) His instincts proved right. By the mid-1970s, French academic art was once more on the rise, and today it represents one of the most active, and lucrative, segments of the international art market.
