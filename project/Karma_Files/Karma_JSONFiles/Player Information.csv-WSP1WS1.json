He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore.

After losing his place in the side, Pankaj sought to make a comeback with strong performances on the domestic circuit.

He made a flying start to the domestic 2005-06 season, with three centuries, and was soon in his country's limited-overs side. In only his third match, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007. But in both matches he suffered from cramps and would be keen to eradicate that problem as he strives for more lengthy innings. He scores heavily from the pull and from slog-sweeping the spinners and his free-flowing game has made him a hit with crowds.

A front-foot player who drives well, Taufeeq is nonetheless a good cutter. He can also bowl some handy offspin. Taufeeq could not have asked for an easier initiation into international cricket - he played his first Test against Bangladesh in 2001, and duly notched up a hundred to become the eighth player to score a century on Test debut for Pakistan. But far more impressive were his subsequent performances - an 88 against a top-class Australian attack was followed by a flawless 135 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2003. On those bouncy pitches, Taufeeq had ample time to play the seamers. He did not get much opportunity in the World Cup, but showed himself to be an absolute asset in Pakistan's home series against South Africa, scoring a hundred and three fifties in four innings.","Batting_Test_matches":"44","Batting_Test_Innings":"83","Batting_Test_Runs":"2963","Batting_Test_Avg":"37.98","Batting_ODI_Matches":"22","Batting_ODI_Innings":"22","Batting_ODI_Runs":"504","Batting_ODI_Highest":"81*","Batting_ODI_Avg":"24","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"236","Batting_T20I_Matches":"156","Batting_T20I_Innings":"273","Batting_T20I_runs":"9544","Batting_T20I_Highest":"236","Batting_T20I_Avg":"36.99","Batting_T20_Matches":"NA","Batting_T20_Innings":"NA","Batting_T20_Runs":"NA","Batting_T20_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20_average":"NA","Test_Debut":"Pakistan v Bangladesh at Multan, Aug 29-31, 2001 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"Pakistan v Sri Lanka at Sharjah, Oct 27, 2001 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Australia A v Pakistanis at Adelaide, Jan 13, 2005 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/512515.html?alt=1","T20I_Debut":"NA" },

Soon afterwards he was sent to the MRF Pace Academy in Chennai to further develop his skills. Playing for Moors SC since 2002 he bowled his club to the Premier league title in 2002-03 capturing 34 wickets (avg. 24.14) in 13 matches. But his career-best performance came the following season when he took a match haul of nine wickets against Colombo Cricket Club to steer Moors to a comprehensive ten-wicket win. He took the majority of his wickets bowling inswing and trapping the batsmen leg before. Welegedera toured Sharjah with the Sri Lanka Academy side and took seven wickets against UAE, which earned him selection for Sri Lanka A. But he suffered an ankle injury and had to be operated in Australia.

Malinga bowls with a distinctive and explosive round-arm action which generates genuine pace and can disconcert batsmen who struggle to pick up the ball's trajectory. Already, he is rated the fastest bowler in Sri Lanka. His first performance in Sri Lankan colours was also impressive - he took 6 for 90 against a Northern Territory Chief Minister's XI.

He went on to play two more matches before his career was cut short by a back injury which kept him out of the game for six months. Having recovered, he was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 2007 where he hoped to perform well and regain his place in the national team. What may have helped him in this quest was his ability to bowl at the death in ODIs, having worked hard to develop subtle variations including a good yorker. Consistent performances on the domestic front earned him a first Test cap against India in August 2008 as Sri Lanka sought to add pace to their attack. He did not disappoint, taking five wickets in the match, including the wicket of India's best batsman, Virender Sehwag, in both innings.","Batting_Test_matches":"15","Batting_Test_Innings":"21","Batting_Test_Runs":"338","Batting_Test_Avg":"16.9","Batting_ODI_Matches":"19","Batting_ODI_Innings":"9","Batting_ODI_Runs":"100","Batting_ODI_Highest":"31*","Batting_ODI_Avg":"25","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"47","Batting_T20I_Matches":"1","Batting_T20I_Innings":"-","Batting_T20I_runs":"-","Batting_T20I_Highest":"-","Batting_T20I_Avg":"-","Batting_T20_Matches":"14","Batting_T20_Innings":"11","Batting_T20_Runs":"48","Batting_T20_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20_average":"8","Test_Debut":"Sri Lanka v India at Colombo (PSS), Aug 8-11, 2008 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"Bangladesh v Sri Lanka at Chittagong, Feb 25, 2006 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Sinhalese Sports Club v Nondescripts Cricket Club at Colombo (CCC), Feb 28, 2007 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/787547.html","T20I_Debut":"NA" },

He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India's highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.","Batting_Test_matches":"58","Batting_Test_Innings":"87","Batting_Test_Runs":"524","Batting_Test_Avg":"9.35","Batting_ODI_Matches":"75","Batting_ODI_Innings":"27","Batting_ODI_Runs":"72","Batting_ODI_Highest":"13","Batting_ODI_Avg":"5.14","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20I_Matches":"14","Batting_T20I_Innings":"3","Batting_T20I_runs":"8","Batting_T20I_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20I_Avg":"8","Batting_T20_Matches":"95","Batting_T20_Innings":"23","Batting_T20_Runs":"45","Batting_T20_Highest":"9","Batting_T20_average":"9","Test_Debut":"Bangladesh v India at Dhaka, May 25-27, 2007 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"India v South Africa at Belfast, Jun 29, 2007 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Delhi v Himachal Pradesh at Delhi, Apr 3, 2007 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/800319.html?alt=3","T20I_Debut":"Australia v India at Melbourne, Feb 1, 2008 scorecard" },

In only his third match, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007.

A front-foot player who drives well, Taufeeq is nonetheless a good cutter. He can also bowl some handy offspin. Taufeeq could not have asked for an easier initiation into international cricket - he played his first Test against Bangladesh in 2001, and duly notched up a hundred to become the eighth player to score a century on Test debut for Pakistan. But far more impressive were his subsequent performances - an 88 against a top-class Australian attack was followed by a flawless 135 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2003. On those bouncy pitches, Taufeeq had ample time to play the seamers. He did not get much opportunity in the World Cup, but showed himself to be an absolute asset in Pakistan's home series against South Africa, scoring a hundred and three fifties in four innings.","Batting_Test_matches":"44","Batting_Test_Innings":"83","Batting_Test_Runs":"2963","Batting_Test_Avg":"37.98","Batting_ODI_Matches":"22","Batting_ODI_Innings":"22","Batting_ODI_Runs":"504","Batting_ODI_Highest":"81*","Batting_ODI_Avg":"24","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"236","Batting_T20I_Matches":"156","Batting_T20I_Innings":"273","Batting_T20I_runs":"9544","Batting_T20I_Highest":"236","Batting_T20I_Avg":"36.99","Batting_T20_Matches":"NA","Batting_T20_Innings":"NA","Batting_T20_Runs":"NA","Batting_T20_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20_average":"NA","Test_Debut":"Pakistan v Bangladesh at Multan, Aug 29-31, 2001 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"Pakistan v Sri Lanka at Sharjah, Oct 27, 2001 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Australia A v Pakistanis at Adelaide, Jan 13, 2005 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/512515.html?alt=1","T20I_Debut":"NA" },

Irfan is a product of rural Pakistan, hailing from the eastern Pakistan town of Gaggu Mandi, which produced another tall former Pakistan quick, Mohammad Zahid. The lack of opportunities in his home town forced him to quit playing cricket and seek full-time employment to support his family. He was working in a plastic pipe factory and playing club cricket before Aaqib Javed had summoned him to the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. Aaqib was enthused by what he saw and soon after, he was playing first-class cricket for Khan Research Laboratories. He took nine wickets in his second game and ended the season with an impressive 43 wickets in ten games. He came close to national selection when he was named as a replacement for one of the injured seamers for the 2010 World Twenty20, but his name was withdrawn.","Batting_Test_matches":"4","Batting_Test_Innings":"7","Batting_Test_Runs":"28","Batting_Test_Avg":"5.6","Batting_ODI_Matches":"33","Batting_ODI_Innings":"20","Batting_ODI_Runs":"39","Batting_ODI_Highest":"12","Batting_ODI_Avg":"4.33","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"14","Batting_T20I_Matches":"8","Batting_T20I_Innings":"2","Batting_T20I_runs":"3","Batting_T20I_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20I_Avg":"-","Batting_T20_Matches":"32","Batting_T20_Innings":"7","Batting_T20_Runs":"24","Batting_T20_Highest":"8","Batting_T20_average":"8","Test_Debut":"South Africa v Pakistan at Cape Town, Feb 14-17, 2013 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"England v Pakistan at Chester-le-Street, Sep 10, 2010 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Multan Tigers v Peshawar Panthers at Karachi, Feb 28, 2010 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/800279.html?alt=3","T20I_Debut":"India v Pakistan at Bangalore, Dec 25, 2012 scorecard" },

He went on to play two more matches before his career was cut short by a back injury which kept him out of the game for six months. Having recovered, he was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 2007 where he hoped to perform well and regain his place in the national team. What may have helped him in this quest was his ability to bowl at the death in ODIs, having worked hard to develop subtle variations including a good yorker. Consistent performances on the domestic front earned him a first Test cap against India in August 2008 as Sri Lanka sought to add pace to their attack. He did not disappoint, taking five wickets in the match, including the wicket of India's best batsman, Virender Sehwag, in both innings.","Batting_Test_matches":"15","Batting_Test_Innings":"21","Batting_Test_Runs":"338","Batting_Test_Avg":"16.9","Batting_ODI_Matches":"19","Batting_ODI_Innings":"9","Batting_ODI_Runs":"100","Batting_ODI_Highest":"31*","Batting_ODI_Avg":"25","Batting_TESTs_Highest":"47","Batting_T20I_Matches":"1","Batting_T20I_Innings":"-","Batting_T20I_runs":"-","Batting_T20I_Highest":"-","Batting_T20I_Avg":"-","Batting_T20_Matches":"14","Batting_T20_Innings":"11","Batting_T20_Runs":"48","Batting_T20_Highest":"NA","Batting_T20_average":"8","Test_Debut":"Sri Lanka v India at Colombo (PSS), Aug 8-11, 2008 scorecard","ODI_Debut":"Bangladesh v Sri Lanka at Chittagong, Feb 25, 2006 scorecard","T20 Debut":"Sinhalese Sports Club v Nondescripts Cricket Club at Colombo (CCC), Feb 28, 2007 scorecard","Image URL-src":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/787547.html","T20I_Debut":"NA" },
